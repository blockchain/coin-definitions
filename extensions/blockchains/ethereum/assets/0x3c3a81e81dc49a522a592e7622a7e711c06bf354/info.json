    "description": "MNT is the native token of Mantle Network, a modular Ethereum Layer 2 built for scalable, low-cost, and EVM-compatible decentralized applications. Originally launched in 2023 through a 1:1 conversion from BIT (BitDAO), MNT powers governance, gas fees, staking, and ecosystem incentives across Mantle's high-performance rollup. It supports integrations like mETH for liquid ETH restaking and Ignition fBTC for native BTC access, while leveraging EigenDA for efficient data availability. MNT holders participate in treasury voting and strategic DAO initiatives, shaping a network with over $1B in TVL and deep DeFi partnerships. Backed by top-tier collaborators and a full ZK roadmap, MNT bridges institutional-grade infrastructure with community-led governance.",
