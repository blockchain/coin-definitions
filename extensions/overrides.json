    "DAI": "Dai (DAI) is a decentralised asset referenced token ('ART') that attempts to maintain a value of $1.00 USD. It is the native token of the Maker platform, which runs on the Ethereum network. Although it is sometimes referred as a 'stablecoin,' DAI is not collateralised (backed) by fiat currency in a bank account maintained by a stablecoin issuer. Instead, DAI is backed by collateral on the Maker platform. If the Dai credit system is upgraded or shut down, DAI holders may be required to convert their DAI to Ethereum through the Maker platform.",
