    "KAMA.SOL": "$KAMA is a Solana-based meme coin inspired by Kamala Harris, the 49th Vice President of the United States. Launched in 2024, the token plays on political satire and blockchain meme culture, with no official affiliation to Harris. It taps into the rising political attention around her candidacy. $KAMA has a fixed supply and operates with a no-tax structure. Built on social media engagement, $KAMA has quickly gained a community of political meme enthusiasts despite its lack of traditional utility. As with all meme coins, users should consider the inherent volatility and speculative nature of the asset. This coin may also be particularly volatile leading up to and after the US presidential election.",
    "MOG": "MOG, the Ethereum token, claims to be a movement in internet culture, tokenizing success, cosmic domination, and meme-driven engagement. Launched in 2023, MOG has gained significant traction through viral memes and a strong community. With its origins rooted in “AMOG” (alpha male of group), the token symbolizes the rise of internet culture in crypto spaces. MOG is an ERC-20 token, compatible with Ethereum-based wallets and DeFi platforms.",
    "TRUMP": "$TRUMP is an Ethereum-based token that merges political satire with blockchain meme culture and philanthropy. The project offers two versions of $TRUMP: a taxed version, which applies a fee on transactions to support donations to US Veterans and Child Trafficking Prevention, and a taxless version with 0% tax on transactions. This one is the taxless $TRUMP. Please be aware that the token’s meme-based nature can lead to significant market volatility. This coin may also be particularly volatile leading up to and after the US presidential election."
