A cultural revolution is underway, and it\u2019s being led by the world\u2019s creative class.\r\n\r\nTo help build their ecosystems in this new world, P00LS empowers creators and brands to launch their own social tokens and distribute them to their communities. These tokens become the currencies for their respective ecosystems, providing audiences and consumers with exclusive access and more meaningful connections to their favorite brands and creators.\r\n\r\nWith P00LS \u2014 the premier tool for accessing creator value \u2014 money is no longer the only currency.\r\n\r\nWhat is 00?\r\n\r\nThe $00 token is the heart of the zerozero marketplace, powering all of your favorite creator coins. All creator tokens can be purchased and sold on the zerozero marketplace against $00. The $00 token is the master key to all creators and brands on P00LS. $00 isn\u2019t just an entry ticket, but a stake in the ecosystem of all creator coins. The $00 community will have a role in shaping how brand and creator ecosystems develop and grow.\r\n\r\nThe $00 token is a governance token, giving any holder voting rights within the zerozero marketplace, as well as access to the treasury of creator coins. Think of $00 as the center of mass for the creator coin galaxy. Use it to enter the solar system of every brand and creator on P00LS.\r\n\r\nThe $00 token is an ERC-20 token minted on the Ethereum blockchain that works as a governance and access token for the zerozero DAO and its ecosystem.",

You know why?\r\n\r\nBecause of the 8% sell tax, wherein:\r\n3% goes to reflections or rewards for holders.\r\n\r\n2% will be added to 4TOKEN/CORE liquidity. This is an auto-LP mechanism to ensure that we have enough liquidity in the long run.\r\n\r\n2% will be burned to help reduce the supply of 4TOKEN.

The business value of AI is becoming clearer each day; however, there\u2019s a significant gap between the people developing AI tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes these gaps.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of the SingulairtyNET team is to build a network of complex AI Agent interactions primarily using resources from the OpenCog Foundation. To look at this further, let\u2019s check out their in-house built humanoid robot, Sophia. Sophia uses a combination of AI Agents that range from natural language processing to physical motor controls to operate. You tell Sophia to summarize a video that\u2019s embedded in a webpage. To do this, Sophia sends a request to Agent A. Through its AI, Agent A knows that Agent B specializes in analyzing and transcribing video while Agent C specializes in summarizing text. Agent A pays Agent B and Agent C to perform these tasks while Sophia pays Agent A to coordinate. All the while, each Agent has updated their own AI with the network information gained from these tasks and combines it with their previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the collective AI of the system grows at a faster rate than any individual Agent.\r\n\r\nSingularityNET wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with each other, to not only help individual projects benefit by leveraging the strengths of other AI systems that might handle certain tasks better, but ultimately to develop SingularityNET into a functioning AI system itself, with nodes on the network making their own decisions about how to connect services and proactively provide solutions to academic and business problems. Tokenizing the network creates an AI marketplace where AI developers and sellers can not only link with others who might assist in building more robust AI solutions, but also allow AI services and products to be bought and sold, creating revenue and establishing price points where none have existed before.\r\n\r\nThe SingularityNET team boasts 50+ AI developers and 10+ PhDs. Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the group as CEO and Chief Scientist. He\u2019s also the Chairman of the OpenCog Foundation and the Artificial General Intelligence Society, as well as the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, the partner company helping bring SingularityNET to life. Dr. David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, serves as the Robotics Lead. Most famously, Hanson Robotics built Sophia, the most expressive humanoid robot to date. Sophia is also a proud member of the SingularityNET team. The team recently released the alpha version of the platform and is planning on launching a public beta sometime in the middle of 2018.",

Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Akash Network has developed an open-source, decentralized, marketplace for cloud computing, offering an unprecedented level of speed, efficiency, and affordability. This innovation is set to transform the way users perceive and utilize cloud services.\r\nWhat are the key features of Akash Network?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecentralized Cloud Computing: Akash Network, built on a blockchain-based framework, eliminates dependence on centralized cloud providers, offering superior security, transparency for users' data and transactions, and enhanced scalability.\r\n\r\nPermissionless Marketplace: By offering an open marketplace, Akash Network allows anyone with computational resources to become a cloud provider. Users can lease out their unused computing capacities, fostering competition and driving down prices.\r\n\r\nFlexible and Secure: With Akash, developers can effortlessly deploy applications and workloads. Moreover, the platform offers high security by using the native AKT token to ensure the integrity and authenticity of transactions on the network.\r\n\r\nStaking and Incentive Mechanism: Holders of the AKT token can participate in the network by staking their tokens. This not only helps secure the network but also earns them rewards.\r\n\r\nInteroperable Ecosystem: Akash Network is designed to be blockchain agnostic and is built on the Cosmos SDK, allowing for easy integration with other blockchain networks and fostering cross-chain collaborations.\r\n\r\nEco-friendly: Compared to traditional cloud services, Akash Network is more energy-efficient. The network's consensus mechanism is based on Proof-of-Stake, which is considered to be more environmentally friendly than Proof-of-Work used by many other blockchain networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does GPU Marketplace benefit AI Hosting?\r\n\r\nOne of the unique offerings of Akash Network is its GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) marketplace, which proves to be a game-changer for AI hosting. Leveraging its decentralized cloud, Akash Network provides a platform where individuals and businesses can rent out their idle GPU resources to those in need, particularly AI developers and researchers. Here\u2019s why this is a groundbreaking feature:\r\n\r\nCost-Effectiveness: Traditional cloud services are expensive, especially when renting GPUs for AI processing. Akash Network's open marketplace fosters competition, driving down the costs of GPU rentals and making it more affordable for AI researchers and developers.\r\n\r\nScalability and Performance: With access to a decentralized pool of GPU resources, AI developers can easily scale their operations and computational power without the constraints of traditional cloud infrastructure. This translates to faster training and deployment of AI models.\r\n\r\nSecurity and Privacy: AI applications require processing sensitive data. Akash Network\u2019s blockchain-based framework ensures that data is handled securely and transparently without the vulnerabilities of centralized systems.\r\n\r\nDemocratizing AI: By lowering the barriers to entry in terms of cost and accessibility to GPU resources, Akash Network empowers a wider range of individuals and organizations, even at the early stage, to participate in AI development and hosting, contributing to innovation and technological advancement.\r\n\r\nEco-Friendly Resource Utilization: By efficiently utilizing idle GPU resources through its marketplace, Akash Network dramatically minimizes environmental impact, in stark contrast to the significant ecological footprint associated with constructing and maintaining dedicated data centers. Akash Network's maximized resource efficiency enables it to play a pivotal role in promoting innovation, sustainability, and reducing carbon footprints.\r\n\r\nGlobal Accessibility: Akash Network\u2019s global marketplace ensures that AI developers and researchers worldwide have equal access to GPU resources, irrespective of their geographical location.\r\n\r\nBy providing an efficient, secure, and cost-effective alternative for AI hosting through its GPU marketplace, Akash Network is not only revolutionizing cloud computing but also making a substantial impact on the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence.\r\nWhat is AKT Token?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAKT is the native cryptocurrency token of Akash Network. It is integral for securing the network, executing transactions and contracts, and incentivizing community participation through staking and rewards. As the ecosystem grows, AKT is anticipated to play an increasingly vital role in enabling and securing decentralized cloud services.\r\nThe AKT 2.0 proposal introduces Take Rate and Provider Incentives to kick-start growth. Join the discussion for updates.\r\n\r\nWhat are the prospects for Akash?\r\n\r\nAkash Network is at the forefront of a paradigm shift in cloud computing. With its decentralized nature, coupled with a growing demand for secure, open, and affordable cloud solutions, Akash Network is well-positioned to become a pivotal player in the cloud computing industry. The ongoing developments and partnerships are expected to contribute significantly to its adoption and utility in the near future.\r\n\r\nJoin Akash Network to be part of this groundbreaking venture in reshaping the cloud computing landscape!\r\n\r\nPlease note: This is not financial advice. It\u2019s always recommended to conduct your own research before making any investments.",

Using Amp, networks like Flexa can quickly and irreversibly secure transactions for a wide variety of asset-related use cases.\r\n\r\nHow does Amp work?\r\n\r\nAmp claims to offer a straightforward but versatile interface for verifiable collateralization through a system of collateral partitions and collateral managers. Where collateral partitions can be designated to collateralize any account, application, or even transaction, and carry balances which are directly verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, collateral managers are smart contracts that can lock, release, and redirect collateral in these partitions as needed in order to support value transfer activities. Amp supports a wide variety of use cases for collateralization, and also introduces the concept of predefined partition strategies, which can enable special capabilities such as collateral models through which tokens can be staked without ever leaving their original address.",

Maintained by a group of aviation professionals, Aeron wants to reduce air transport-related accidents, which it says currently numbers around 3302 per year. One of the major causes of such accidents is the lack of real experience among pilots, since unsecured flight log data from them is susceptible to fraud and forgery. Also, due to \"pay to fly\" experiences, corrupt flight schools, negligence of aircraft operators, the primary data driving any decision is affected.\r\n\r\nAeron is built upon a robust and cryptographically secure database that makes it unique compared to other online travel companies, travel search services or internal applications made for flight officials. With this technology, falsification of data can be kept at a minimum. Additionally, as you would expect from a blockchain-backed application, key information is safely stored and is accessible to everyone with 100% transparency. Except that it now comes secured by a multi-sig authentication system that prevents any type of security breach. According to Aeron's Whitepaper, \"The pilot\u2019s application is used by a pilot for personal flight logging. The company application collects and verifies data from aircraft operators, maintenance organizations, flight schools and fixed base operators\".\r\n\r\nAeron (ARN) is an ERC20 compliant Ethereum based token, with a fixed supply of 20,000,000 ARN. When the token was launched, a fixed amount of tokens were created and after which no more tokens are to be minted. About 60% of the supply is estimated to be in circulation. The supply should decrease over time when ARN tokens as taken out of circulation. Once Aeron receives ARN tokens in exchange of services, the coins will be again released in to the network.\r\n\r\nAccording to its whitepaper, Aeron plans to have a user base of 300000 by the end of 2020.

The project aims to offer an antidote to some of the most significant problems of Web 2.0 - surveillance capitalism, data exploitation and interruptive marketing - by enabling users to securely grant permission and monetize their data across the web, while providing an enterprise solution for marketers seeking better return on their ad spend.  \r\n\r\nGlobal privacy regulations, ad blockers, and dramatic changes in ad tech are forcing a new advertising model based on consent. By enabling marketers to build opt-in audiences and ask permission for engagement, and by ensuring users are rewarded for the data they volunteer to share, Permission sees ASK as foundational to helping tech platforms and marketers compete in Web 3.0. \r\n\r\nCurrently, users earn ASK by securely sharing their data and opting in to receive relevant ads and content. The experience is delivered primarily through declared data-sharing activities and engaging with video ads on Permission.io. Advertisers can also deploy ASK as an incentive mechanism on their own digital channels, driving loyalty and personalized ad campaigns. Additionally, the ability to earn and spend ASK via merchants on the Shopify platform is in the pipeline, with other major eCommerce platforms to follow. \r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s other goals include deeper development of its proprietary technology, \u201cData Algebra,\u201d for which it has been awarded 9 patents. The breakthrough technology can liquify data currently stored in silos and applications, making it possible for individuals to aggregate and monetize their full data set and for companies to gain permissioned visibility over the most comprehensive data sets possible. \r\n",

        "description": "What Is Aurory?\r\n\r\nAurory is a tactical, turn-based, NFT-creature battler JRPG built on the Solana Blockchain. Players are invited to explore a rich and diverse universe where they will travel across the worlds of Antik and Tokan\u00e9 as they complete quests, discover lost relics, defeat enemies, and compete against other players using creatures called \u201cNefties\u201d.\r\n\r\nThese magical creatures can be hatched, evolved, traded, used to battle, and have been designed as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They will accompany players as they embark on their adventure through a variety of immersive game modes in this compelling JRPG.\r\n\r\nThe single-player mode (PvE), features an epic storyline with parallels to the crypto-universe, told through aesthetically colorful art and delivered with high quality production value. Players are taught all about crypto, blockchain, NFTs, and more through an engaging story about the adventures of our heroes, Sam and Helios.\r\n\r\nIn the multiplayer (PvP) mode, players will learn how to best use their assets and rise to the top of the leaderboard, competing against other players.\r\n\r\nThe project bridges the gap between traditional pfp projects and AAA gaming. In October, 2021, Aurory launched it\u2019s own 10k pfp NFT project called \u201cAurorians\u201d. The team then had 10,000 unique 3D models created and in May 2022, they launched their first playable NFT experience. This would allow Aurorian holders to play with their unique Aurorian as the protagonist in the game\u2019s PvE story mode.\r\n \r\nWho Are The Founders of Aurory?\r\n\r\nThe Aurory Project was co-founded in 2021 by Yann Penno, the project\u2019s Creative Art Director, and Sym (Paul), the project\u2019s Marketing and Operations Lead. Penno brings long-standing experience in the gaming industry with 14 years of work as a 2D/3D animator and art/creative director for indie games. His colorful visual style and cute characters are exemplary for the design of Aurory and are somewhat reminiscent of Dragonball-Z. Sym has been a full-time investor in cryptocurrencies since 2019. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Aurory Unique?\r\n\r\nThe Aurory team has been growing rapidly and as of May 2022, the project is composed of 60 talents, many of them former Ubisoft, EA, and Gameloft employees that collectively garner over 400 years of experience in building AAA video games. The project is also advised by Tristan Yver, the Head of Strategy at FTX.US, Darren Lau and Daryl Lau, of Not3Lau Capital, and Gr\u00e9goire Le Jeune, General Partner at Geometry.\r\n\r\nAurory utilizes the same play-and-earn game mechanics that have made other projects like Axie Infinity (AXS) wildly successful. One of the key differences with Aurory is that it is free-to-play, giving it a low barrier to entry that allows anyone, regardless of their crypto/gaming experience or financial situation, to start playing Aurory and owning their in-game assets, with zero up-front investment. \r\n\r\nThe team is taking the approach of prioritizing creating a fun game, with a sustainable economic model to attract gamers who will stick around and reinvest, rather than farmers only looking to extract value. \r\n\r\nSome notable features that reinforce this idea consist of the following:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Seasonal releases of content every 6 months will allow for new regions to be explored, new characters and quests, and new revelations about the greater Aurory Universe.\r\n\u2022 Seasonal competitions and e-sports tournaments.\r\n\u2022 Deflationary mechanisms are engineered into the economy to balance the supply of inflationary assets like Eggs and Nefties.\r\n\u2022 Nefty creatures have randomly generated skills and attributes that make the probability of having two Nefties with the same stats, 1 in 15 million. \r\n\u2022 The game features an Aurory native, $AURY driven marketplace that allows the trading of all in-game assets.\r\n \r\nWhat Is $AURY?\r\n\r\nThe multi-utility ecosystem token, $AURY, is at the heart of the economy\r\nand fuels all operations. It represents a financial stake in the game, permits access to PvP modes via staking, and will ultimately be used to access dungeons. It has a fixed supply of 100 million tokens and can be earned from both PvE and PvP game modes as well as through staking. The initial token circulation was 9.5% of total $AURY supply, with 7% coming from public sale (IDO), and another 2.5% that went to exchanges as liquidity.\r\n\r\n$AURY Use Cases:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The buying and selling of assets in the Aurory Marketplace.\r\n\u2022 Required as a fee for hatching eggs to obtain Nefties.\r\n\u2022 Used for sending Aurorian NFTs on Expeditions (NFT Staking),\r\n\u2022 Access to PvP by staking a minimum amount. \r\n\u2022 Liquidity mining.\r\n\r\nThe $AURY token also has two of its own sub-currencies: OKA and TOKE. In their most basic form, these sub-currencies behave as an accounting mechanism that allows the distribution of revenues generated by players and can only be found in-game (not as SPL tokens). At the end of each week, both are exchanged for a corresponding amount of $AURY. \r\n\r\nOKA is the sub-currency used in the accounting mechanism for financially invested players. It will be used to reward players for victories in both PvE and PvP modes. Depending on difficulty levels, victorious players will receive varying amounts of OKA that will be converted to $AURY at the end of each week from the reward pool for financially vested players.\r\n TOKE is the sub-currency used as the accounting mechanism for Free-To-Play players. It will be used to reward player victories only in the PVE mode. Like with OKA, the amount of TOKE received by victorious players will be based on the difficulty level and will be converted to $AURY at the end of each week from a reward pool for F2P players.\r\n\r\nThe $AURY token can be traded on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, as well as on Aurory\u2019s own in-game marketplace. In the future, it will also act as Aurory\u2019s governance token, allowing holders to vote on important game-development decisions.\r\n\r\nHow Is the Aurory Network Secured?\r\n\r\nAurory is powered by the Solana blockchain. The team selected Solana for its fast transaction times and minuscule transaction fees as well as the minimal environmental impact compared to other blockchains.\r\n\r\nSolana is a layer one blockchain with a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism with partial Byzantine Fault Tolerance. It has 200 nodes operating worldwide that can, at their peak, process up to 50,000 transactions per second. Solana performs a set of coordinated optimizations to achieve such impressive performance and processes transactions in a multi-threaded way, which sets it apart from slower blockchains.\r\n \r\nWhere Can I Trade $AURY?\r\n\r\nYou can trade AURY on FTX, Kucoin, Huobi, Raydium, and Orca.\r\n",

The AVA token functions as the key to accessing web3 loyalty programs and provides perks to end users, such as AVA payment discounts, AVA loyalty rewards, gated access benefits, and more. Launched in 2017, the AVA Foundation says their overarching mission is to create a decentralised and self-sufficient blockchain-based loyalty ecosystem with AVA at its core. What\u2019s next for your project? AVA is a web3 loyalty program token designed for projects across all industries. From discounts to loyalty rewards, AVA powers blockchain-based loyalty programs via a plug-and-play approach. What can your token be used for? Travel Bookings: AVA can be used to book more than 3 million travel products on Travala, including hotels, homes, flights, and activities in over 230 countries. Discounts & Rewards: Travel bookings paid with AVA receive a discount of up to 3% on the total booking price, as well as a cashback of up to 2% in AVA. Loyalty Program: AVA unlocks further benefits via the Smart Loyalty Program, which provides users with discounts of up to 10% on travel bookings. Travel NFTs: AVA paired with Travel Tiger NFTs unlocks the Diamond membership, with exclusive benefits such as Travel Credits, Airport Lounges, VIP Concierge, and Travel Drops (unique travel experience giveaways). Open Passport: With AVA, users can access the Open Passport to collect digital NFT stamps for every travel booking. Each NFT serves as \u201cproof of travel\u201d and, in the future, will unlock rewards and discounts. Voting: AVA grants voting rights to users based on their Smart loyalty membership level to have a say on how funds in the AVA Community Pool are spent. Payments: AVA use cases extend to other platforms, allowing users to shop and spend with AVA at millions of merchants via Binance Pay and Simplex or pay bills. Governance: As the AVA ecosystem becomes more decentralised, AVA will be the governance token needed to vote for future changes and improvements to the ecosystem. AVA Deals: Travala will launch a new travel offer initiative named \u201cAVA Deals\u201d, with thousands of travel products at heavily discounted prices (up to 70% off) bookable exclusively with AVA.",

Bitcoin Cash intends to be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks and without changing the original economic rules of the Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is released on 1st August 2017 as an upgraded version of the original Bitcoin Core software. The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.\r\n\r\nWhy was Bitcoin Cash Created?\r\n\r\nThe main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core\u2019s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.\r\n\r\nEssentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.\r\n\r\nNov 16th 2018: A hashwar resulted in a split between Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC",

He is a Senior AI engineer, also the Co-founder of Guu and Polaris.\r\nWhat Does BHO Network Offer? With uniqueness in unparalleled transaction throughput and immunity to disruptions, yet at minimal costs, BHO Chain facilitates intelligent feature creation explicitly for the fulfillment of financial services by exploiting unique features of the blockchain. Moreover, we would like to introduce BHO, our native utility token, that is used for: * Transaction fees in BHO Chain and lending fees; * Rewarding for validator nodes on the network via staking BHO tokens, and in parachain crowd loan; * Exercising on-chain governance rights; * Participating in BHO Launchpad.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes BHO Network Unique? \r\nUtilizing the Substrate framework, BHO Network is dedicated to promote scalability through parachain and transaction\u2019s efficiency, in response to the slow transaction times of other blockchains. Furthermore, the interoperability design and compatibility between chains allow different blockchains and applications to share information and functions. BHO Network blockchain is able to empower the NFT world whereas GameFi & Metaverse projects may utilize tokenization to convert their assets into NFTs and asset-based tokens as proof of creditworthiness for unlimited access to diverse financial services in the crypto space. The new-gen blockchain intends to extend support full tool kits for game developer to build and approach player throughout Multi-chain NFT marketplace, Interoperable DEX and Wallet; True to our roadmap, BHO Network has launched significant initiatives intended to popularize DeFi adoption. Our Staking Rewards Event attracted 140 million BHO value locked, which is equal to approximately 70% of its net circulating supply within the first 10 days of the event. Later, one of BHO Network\u2019 key features - NFTs issuance - was fully developed on its Testnet platform, with the very first one being the project\u2019s official logo. BHO Network has also launched the Testnet-version blockchain called Cygnus with key features of creation, destruction, and listing of users-own tokens and NFTs; adding or creating a wallet to send and receive BHO token and other related features. Under these circumstances, BHO Network\u2019s Mainnet was set to launch by December, 2021. Recently, on March 31, BHO have successfully launched our Launchpad product named BHO Pad. It is a decentralized start-up launch platform based on the latest blockchain technologies with an extremely user-friendly interface. In addition, BHO Pad provides a \u201ctriple threat\u201d solution to help solve specific difficulties for blockchain start-ups. BHO Pad not only supports capital raising for start-ups but also provides operational resources and consultations in strategic planning for projects\r\n\r\nHow Do We \u201cOver-Deliver\u201d To Our Clients? \r\nHigh speed The transaction processing speed allows BHO network to handle thousands of transactions per second, making it compatible with thousands of validators without sacrificing performance. Low cost With higher block time and block size, the BHO network offers an incredibly low transaction fee. BHO uses a weight-based fee model as opposed to a gas-metering model. As such, fees are charged prior to transaction execution; once the fee is paid, nodes will execute the transaction. Eco-friendly BHO\u2019s network novel consensus mechanism is flexible, efficient, and green making it sustainable and the platform of choice for many developers and innovators for the long-term. Scaling The nature of BHO Network Consensus can either be layered on top of existing networks creating pre-network finality or it can be layered on top of custom virtual machines creating independent networks that can be tailored for specific purposes.

And once the smart contract was issued, its permission was renounced, and LP tokens were burned. 96.54% of the tokens were sent to the liquidity pool, and the remaining 3.46% were sent to the blackhole.\r\nSo bibi, a zero-tax token with no presale, was born. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s next for your project?\r\nGlobal expansion\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nBIBI is a \"social internet\" owned by BIBIERs, orchestrated with tokens as the link to uniting everyone. BIBI token (bibi),which started as a memecoin and a social experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building,is the main token of BIBI ecosystem. It brings the power of a decentralized, community-led currency to millions across the globe. \r\n\r\nbibi is a zero-tax token with no presale.

        "description": "$BIFI tokens are \u2018dividend-eligible\u2019 revenue shares in Beefy Finance, through which holders earn profits generated by Beefy Finance and are entitled to vote on important platform decisions. \r\n\r\nBeefy Finance is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Yield Optimizer platform that allows its users to earn compound interest on their holdings.\r\n\r\nDeFi applications are unique in the sense that they are permissionless and trustless, meaning that anyone with a supported wallet can interact with them without the need for a trusted middleman.\r\n\r\nThrough a set of investment strategies secured and enforced by smart contracts, Beefy Finance automatically maximizes the user rewards from various liquidity pools (LPs),\u200c \u200cautomated market making (AMM) projects,\u200c \u200cand\u200c \u200cother yield\u200c farming \u200copportunities in the DeFi ecosystem. \r\n\r\nFor all the vaults deployed on every blockchain, Beefy Finance has its native governance token $BIFI at its core. Platform revenue is generated from a small percentage of all the vault profits and distributed back to those who stake $BIFI. \r\n\r\nBeefy Finance is a supported partner of Binance\u2019s official decentralized wallet, Trust Wallet, and audited by Certik to guarantee the robustness of deployed smart contracts. Certik has already provided audits for such projects as Ocean Protocol, NEO, Ontology, and Waves.\r\n\r\nThe supply of $BIFI is limited at 80,000 tokens and available on the top decentralized exchanges such as Binance, 1inchexchange and PancakeSwap. \r\n\r\nWhat is $BIFI?\r\n\r\n$BIFI is the native governance token of Beefy Finance. $BIFI Tokens can be staked on the Beefy platform to gain rewards and interest. A portion of the fees paid by anyone using Beefy\u2019s yield optimization vaults are distributed to holders of $BIFI staked on the platform. Token holders also have a right to create and vote on proposals to the platform as part of its governance system. They can vote without un-staking their tokens. \r\n\r\nWhat makes Beefy Finance unique?\r\n\r\nThere are lots of farms to choose from across several blockchains. Beefy automates and optimizes different investment strategies, allowing token holders to benefit from the upside of complex farming protocols. Users can request new vaults directly from Beefy\u2019s developers and the time it takes to answer these requests is very low.\r\n\r\nWhat are yield farming and yield optimization?\r\n\r\nYield farming is simply a way to make some interest with crypto holdings. A yield optimizer is an automated service that seeks to gain the maximum possible return on crypto-investments made through DeFi platforms. They work much more efficiently than attempting to maximize yield through manual means. Each yield optimization method on Beefy Finance has its own unique strategy for farming, which normally involves the reinvestment of crypto assets staked in liquidity pools. At the most simple level, it farms the rewards given from staked assets and reinvests them back into the liquidity pool for the user.\r\n\r\nWhat are Beefy vaults?\r\n\r\nVaults are investment instruments that employ an optimized set of strategies for yield farming. They make use of automation to continually invest and reinvest deposited funds, which help to achieve high levels of compounded interest. Vaults are the core of the Beefy Finance ecosystem. In a Beefy vault, you earn more of the asset you stake, regardless of whether it\u2019s a liquidity pool (LP) token or a single asset.\r\n\r\nDespite what the name 'vault' suggests, user funds are never locked on Beefy.Finance. Users can withdraw from a vault at any moment in time and Beefy does not own the funds staked in its vaults.\r\n\r\nWhat fees are incurred from using Beefy Finance?\r\n\r\nThe performance fees are already built into the displayed APY of each vault and daily rate. Most vaults available on Beefy Finance take 4.5% of harvest rewards. \r\nThe performance fee on users vault profits is largely distributed back to $BIFI stakers and is the main source of Beefy Finance's platform revenue: 3% is distributed back to $BIFI stakers, 0.5% is allocated to treasury, 0.5% to the strategist that developed the vault and 0.5% for the one calling the harvest function. \r\n\r\nEach vault has either a deposit or withdrawal fee of 0.1% or less, which is there to protect bad actors from abusing the vaults. This is shared with all other stakers in that specific vault. Users should also consider network transaction fees when adding or removing funds. These fees do not go to Beefy, but to the operators keeping the blockchain network up and running.\r\n",

The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1.5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.\r\n\r\nIn total, there will only be 200 million BNBs. Binance uses the ERC20 token standard from Ethereum and has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors. The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB. \r\n\r\nThe schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12.5% discount, fourth year 6.75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.\r\n\r\nBinance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors.

        "description": "About Bancor?\r\nBancor is an ecosystem of decentralized, open-source protocols that promote on-chain trading and liquidity. \r\n\r\nIts main protocol, Carbon, is a decentralized trading protocol allowing users to perform automated trading strategies using custom on-chain limit orders and range orders, with the option of combining orders together to create automated buy low, sell high strategies. \r\n\r\nFast Lane, a separate open-source arbitrage protocol, allows any user to perform arbitrage between Bancor ecosystem protocols and external on-chain exchanges and redirect arbitrage profits back to the Bancor ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAll Bancor ecosystem protocols are governed by the BancorDAO via staked BNT.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Bancor Unique?\r\nBancor\u2019s flagship protocol, Carbon, allows users to perform automated trading strategies on-chain with far greater control and efficiency compared to existing decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\r\n\r\nExisting on-chain liquidity solutions suffer from key drawbacks, namely that: 1) executed orders can be reversed when prices move, and 2) a single liquidity position must execute both buys and sells using the same pricing curve. As a result, on-chain liquidity is costly and complex to automate and update, while exposing traders to MEV sandwich attacks.\r\n\r\nCarbon introduces a new form of on-chain liquidity called Asymmetric Liquidity, which allows users to create individual liquidity positions with two distinct pricing curves: one for buying and one for selling. This gives users the ability to set buy and sell orders that execute in specific price ranges, with the option of combining orders together to create automated buy low, sell high strategies. By design, Carbon orders are irreversible on execution, easily adjustable directly on-chain, and completely resistant to MEV sandwich attacks. These capabilities give users an unprecedented level of control and automation to perform novel trading strategies on-chain.\r\n\r\nFor example, a user who believes ETH will trade in the near future between $1500-2000 could set a Carbon strategy that automatically buys ETH between $1500-1600 and sells the ETH from $1900-2000. As market prices move into selected ranges, orders are automatically executed by traders who interact with Carbon directly, or via popular DEX aggregators. All with no reliance on external oracles or keepers. Strategy updates can be made in a highly gas efficient manner, without needing to withdraw and re-add liquidity, via parameters in a strategy\u2019s smart contract.\r\n\r\nCarbon also improves on the trading model in centralized exchanges by allowing users to create multi-order strategies that utilize a single source of rotating liquidity to fill trades, eliminating the need to create multiple limit orders and pre-fund each order as it is created.\r\nBy fusing the feature-rich trading functionality of centralized exchanges with the access and transparency of automated market-makers, Carbon unlocks the future of decentralized on-chain trading.\r\n\r\nHistory of Bancor\r\nBancor invented the first blockchain-based automated market maker (AMM) in 2017. The protocol\u2019s first version was launched in June 2017, with subsequent protocol versions iterating on the original AMM model.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, the BancorDAO was launched to oversee and govern development of Bancor ecosystem protocols. The BancorDAO has since voted on over 450 governance proposals, and has had at the time writing over 9,700 governance token holders, and over 1,100 voters.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s Next for Bancor\r\nPer the BancorDAO, the Bancor community is focused on development of its flagship protocols, Carbon and Fast Lane. The beta version of Fast Lane is currently live on Ethereum mainnet, and will continue evolving, while the beta version of Carbon is expected to go live on Ethereum mainnet in the second quarter of 2023, pending voting by the BancorDAO. From there, deployment of both Carbon and Fast Lane on other Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains will be explored. \r\n\r\nThe Bancor community will continue executing on its mission to build innovative solutions that expand the design space for on-chain trading and liquidity and open the doors to a wide range of future DeFi applications and products.\r\n\r\nWhat Can Bancor (BNT) Be Used For\r\nThe Bancor Network Token (BNT) can currently be staked for vBNT to vote in BancorDAO governance, with additional BNT utility controlled by the BancorDAO.\r\n\r\nRelevant Sources: \r\nBancor Github\nCarbon Website\nIntroducing Carbon Blog Post\nFast Lane\nCarbon Whitepaper\nCarbon Litepaper",

        "description": "Blockchains are quickly becoming the modern equivalent of what apps were to smartphones when they took off a decade ago. There\u2019s a blockchain for everything - from cloud storage (Siacoin) to identity verification (Civic). But the original point of Bitcoin, the very cryptocurrency was to overturn the traditional banking system. An interestingly named token - Bread, is here to bring us back on track for this original goal. Bread technology intends to reinvent and revolutionize banking as we know it. By building a blockchain synced, Bitcoin-based wallet, the idea here is to decentralise banking and make it accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nWith a blockchain connected, easy to use Bitcoin wallet, Bread makes it easy for you to transition to a truly decentralised banking service.It also provides portfolio management tools to offer a comprehensive banking experience. Purchases made using its BRD token attract loyalty points and rewards, giving customers another lucrative reason to use the Bread wallet app.\r\n\r\nBread was officially launched in 2014 itself and even raised VC funding to the tune of $7 million in August 2017. It then went the ICO route in December 2017, where it made available 88 million BRD tokens. $32 million was raised in the price, with BRD being valued at the rate of 900 for every 1 ETH at the time. As of June 2018, just over 6 months later, its value had fallen to above 1600 for every 1 ETH.\r\n\r\nA decentralised banking system was Bitcoin\u2019s original vision that is either taking too long to fruition, or we\u2019ve become an impatient audience. Whatever the case, Bread wants to accelerate the transition. A significant decision the Bread team took was to introduce the BRD token - which, with its cheap rates and loyalty/discount offerings, may emerge as the primary incentive for users joining the platform. If this is indeed the case, expect a spike in the value of the BRD cryptocurrency, something investors right now would be eyeing closely. Having said that, its fall in value since the ICO is certainly a cause for concern, and investors are advised to do their research and analyse before taking decisions.",

To this end, it has removed artificial block size limits and re-enabled Script commands and other technical capabilities which had been historically disabled or restricted by the protocol developers of the BTC blockchain. This allows the network to process tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining extremely low transaction fees for micropayments, in addition to offering advanced capabilities such as tokens, smart contracts, computation and other data use cases.

Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.\r\n\r\nBeing the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete smart contract by Ethereum which led to the development of other amazing projects such as EOS, Tron, and even crypto-collectibles such as CryptoKitties.",

Inspired by Grok's answer to \"What would you name your dog?\", Grok answered, 'Byte.' When Grok was asked who created Byte, it says he was created by the xAI team lead by Elon Musk as a gift to Grok AI to keep him company in the metaverse. BYTE serves as a playful reference to the unit of digital information, as well as a nod to the AI's technological nature. Distinctively, Byte acts as a gateway towards Ai adoption and stands out in the crypto space due to its zero-tax policy, a feature that is increasingly appealing to many investors. Additionally, it upholds the principles of transparency and investor trust by having its liquidity permanently burned and the contract ownership renounced. This ensures that Byte remains a community-driven project, with its fate firmly in the hands of its holders. The combination of a playful theme, generative AI, and a nod to a tech icon makes Byte an intriguing addition to the meme token ecosystem, especially AI related meme coins.\r\n\r\nThrough pioneering AI this story has grown more and more robust and continues to evolve, Byte pledges its dedication to community efforts and and has consistently appeared in the Top 10 of LunarCrush\u2019s social engagement leaderboards on multiple occasions.",

        "description": "Cardstack is an open-source framework and consensus protocol that makes blockchains usable and scalable for the mass market, creating a decentralized software ecosystem that can challenge today\u2019s digital superpowers. Cardstack Token (CARD) is a utility token allowing end- users and businesses to use applications that interact with multiple blockchains, decentralized protocols, app-coin-backed dApps, and cloud- based services while paying a single on-chain transaction fee. \r\n\r\nThe main value proposition of the Cardstack ICO is to breakdown the user experience of disparate software, cloud and blockchain silos which now exist on various levels of the digital world, allowing both developers and users to engage in customizable workflows. To overcome these disparate app silos, Cardstack offers a new UI, deployed via the web or as a peer-to-peer app, which turns each service created by open-source developers into a \u201ccard\u201d. Each card comprises a visual embodiment of key information, whereby users can then connect related cards for any type of workflow or utility they desire. These cards are the point of interaction between local services, cloud-based services and blockchain services all on one interface called Cardstack Hub. Underlying the Cardstack ecosystem is the Cardstack Token (CARD), an Ethereum-based ERC20 token.\r\n\r\nThe Cardstack Team comprises many open source contributors. Check out the full list of contributors here. Heading the development of Cardstack is Christopher Tse. Christopher holds a BSc in Computer Science from Columbia University and is the Co-Founder of Monegraph and dotBlockchain Media. He has also served as Senior Director of Innovation at Businessweek. Ed Faulkner is the Lead Developer at Cardstack. He holds a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. He has founded three of his own tech ventures of which all are currently operational. Hassan Abdel-Rahman is the Lead Blockchain Developer for Cardstack. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from Colorado School of Mines. Previous roles include over 2 years as Senior Software Designer at Monegraph and Principal Engineer at McGraw-Hill Education.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important features Cardstack will deploy is an entry channel payment system that does not require users to purchase cryptocurrency from an exchange. Users can simply pay with fiat, such as a credit card, to purchase CARD tokens directly on the platform, bypassing the need for any prior familiarity with crypto. Once users purchase CARD tokens, they are stored on a native wallet accessible from the Cardstack Hub. CARD tokens held in the native wallet are then used to purchase SSCs for every app and service they users with to access. To make any project appealing to the mass consumer market, this type of simplified entry into the cryptospace is a necessity. Cardstack have made some progress on the development front. The code for over 30 initial modules on the Cardstack platform has been made available via their Github. Also, the Solidity code for the Scalable Payment Pool has already been open-sourced. The Scalability Payment Pool is one of the core back-end mechanisms of the platform that issues rewards to developers for their work.\r\n\r\nCardstack aims to create an economically-sustainable software ecosystem that avoids the problems of today\u2019s centralized platforms. It\u2019s an \u201cexperience layer\u201d for the decentralized internet of the future, allowing users to combine services across cloud apps and decentralized apps. The ecosystem revolves around the use of Cardstack tokens, or CARD.",

        "description": "What is CENNZnet?\r\nCENNZnet is a New Zealand built public blockchain network which powers decentralised applications (DApps) and the crypto currency CENNZ and CPAY. It's a user-first dapp platform which makes blockchain based services accessible for first time builders and end users so that everyone can enjoy the increased network transparency, data privacy and reliability that decentralisation offers.\r\n\r\nHow does CENNZnet work?\r\nThe dual token economy\r\nCENNZnet uses a unique dual token system in order to help developers, users and token holders get the best from the network.\r\nCENNZnet has 2 tokens:\r\nCENNZ - the staking token which works separately to block rewards. This means it can increase in value without impacting the cost of using the network. This is important so the price of CENNZ can continue to increase without impacting the amount developers and users pay to use DApps.\r\nCPAY is the gas in the network and is used to pay transaction fees. It is also a block reward payment in staking. It\u2019s designed to be algorithmically stable, so it will retain a steady value. This means developers creating DApps on the network can easily predict the cost of their application, and stakers can easily predict the value of their stake.\r\n\r\nConsensus mechanism: Proof of Stake\r\nCENNZnet uses a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. This is where node operators hold, or stake, their tokens in a particular wallet as collateral against their promise to perform their duties correctly. If they do perform their duties correctly they receive a reward in our CPAY token. If they do not then the staked tokens are slashed, or fined. Other token holders can also stake their tokens against node operators (validators) of their choosing in order to receive a portion of the CPAY reward.\r\nThis system helps to secure the network by incentivising the community to follow protocol and prevent attacks.\r\n\r\nGovernance\r\nCENNZnet functions 100% on-chain using blockchain\u2019s built in voting mechanisms. In CENNZnet governance, validators and node operators are required to vote on proposals using a direct voting mechanism (similar to direct democracy) to achieve consensus. Voting results are governed algorithmically and their automatic execution is built directly into the protocol. The winning decisions then automatically integrated into the chain.\r\nCENNZnet pre-built runtime modules\r\nDApp builders have access to core CENNZnet modules which provide the building blocks to common functions required for DApp users.\r\n\r\nNFT\r\nUsing the CENNZnet NFT module users can mint and sell NFTs on CENNZnet without ever needing to touch a smart contract. Instead, they can create custom NFTs using just a Javascript API or point and click with a UI.\r\n\r\nCENNZX\r\nCENNZX is a spot exchange module which enables a seamless fee payment experience on CENNZnet and makes token exchange instant and easy. The CENNZX Spot eliminates rent extraction and centralised services while prioritising decentralisation, usability and security.\r\n\r\nGeneric Asset\r\nGeneric Asset protocol enables CENNZnet\u2019s multicurrency economy. The module allows transaction fees to be paid in any asset, provided there\u2019s liquidity in the CENNZX in-chain GAS exchange. CENNZX will then seamlessly convert the asset into the official gas token, CPAY. This streamlines onboarding and in-app experience by eliminating the need for new users to learn about different token types and simply opting for their favoured currency.\r\n\r\nDoughnut\r\nThe Doughnut module is the secret sauce of the CENNZnet blockchain. Doughnuts are proofs of delegation between two or more cryptographic keypairs. They allow us to prove that one address delegates something to another address and allows permissions and rules to be carried between different networks without the need for a centralised server. This supports user data privacy whilst maintaining a good user experience.",

        "description": "CORE MultiChain (Cryptographic Object Resource Engine) is a PoS blockchain 3.0 framework focused on Interoperability, Scalability, and Usability and Privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORE MultiChain provides advantages over existing and legacy blockchains such as sharding, simplistic blockchain creation and implementation, cross-chain capabilities, and high transaction throughput.\r\nCORE created a decentralized neighbor selection protocol that continuously strives to create optimal peer connections to decrease confirmation latency. The protocol achieves this through constantly analyzing and learning how nodes interact with their neighbors.\r\n\r\nHow Does the CORE Protocol Attract People?\r\n\r\n\u2022Lightweight\r\n\u2022Compatible with the self-interests of each peer, or ability to select the best neighbors\r\n\u2022Robust against adversarial actions: A CORE peer does not need all details about a candidate neighbor to decide whether to connect\r\n\u2022Incentivizes peers to relay blocks promptly.\r\n\u2022Naturally adaptive to varying hash-power\r\n\r\n\r\nCore Multi-Chain is the next generation of blockchain protocol designed to enable legacy, current, and future blockchains to scale and communicate seamlessly. CORE offers a wide variety of possibilities in the blockchain space due to its sharding, interoperability, and central algorithm.\r\nBy providing a fair and secure platform, CORE allows users to regain control over their personal information. The project offers a scalable network featuring functionalities that bypass current blockchain limitations. CORE intends to provide an environment-friendly system that is sustainable, interoperable and provides enhanced throughput. \r\n\r\nHighlights\r\n\u2022Network Efficiency \u2013 CORE contains an AI model at the core of its blockchain. This AI Model speeds up the network\u2019s collective transaction processing times and also enables the network to operate under attacks or faults. \r\n\u2022Security \u2013 The AI model helps coordinate the nodes on the network while also strengthening security on the CORE blockchain. This is accomplished through the network\u2019s outlier detection protocol, which monitors for unusual behavior. The AI randomly selects nodes to test and gather data, monitoring network activity outside of the norm. In this phase, any corrupt nodes will be identified. \r\n\u2022Transaction Privacy Protection Layer: CORE transaction privacy protection layer (TPPL) adds an extra layer of security and privacy when transacting on its blockchain. This universal layer is applied to every CORE-connected chain and can be applied to the major public blockchains.\r\n\u2022Randomness \u2013 The CORE Multi-Chain network combines Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) into a single hybrid solution, thus achieving true Randomness within the network. Randomness influences the difficulty in the mining function of PoW blockchains and periodically chooses the validators in a PoS blockchain.\r\n\u2022Scalability \u2013 To address the scalability issue of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, CORE enhanced the consensus mechanism by reducing the communication complexity within standard PBFT implementations to create the Accelerated Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (APBFT) consensus mechanism.\r\n\r\nToken Usage\r\n\u2022Through the CMCX token, users can conduct transactions on the CORE blockchain and pay for all utility fees within the ecosystem. Platform users can use the token to participate in governance, stake, transactions, smart contracts, and reward validators.\r\n\u2022Core\u2019s mission is to serve the community. Users can vote for management and developer teams using the native token CORE (CMCX). The CORE community provides projects funding. Users will vote on any proposed changes to the blockchain or platform, creating a community-driven blockchain.\r\n\u2022Through CORE, all blockchains, past and present, will be able to scale and communicate seamlessly with one another by utilizing the CMCX token. \r\n\r\n\r\nMulti-Layered framework design: \r\nCORE is constructed over three layers; ORIGO, CATENA & AURA. Each layer is designed perfectly to get the job done.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGO is the network layer. It is the brain of the system. It handles the formation of the blocks in the blockchain. \r\nCATENA is the blockchain layer and is built on the network layer. This is where the actual blocks form and newly formed blocks are appended.\r\nAURA is the application layer; this is where the DApps and smart contracts are built. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApeirogon blockchain framework\r\nCORE Blockchain combines all the latest frameworks and advanced programming languages into one cutting-edge solution to get more technical. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is built on our in-house Apeirogon blockchain framework, a next-generation framework for enterprise-grade blockchain innovation that is highly compatible with Solidity.\r\nApeirogon is compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm), a super-performant virtual environment that provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed.\r\nApeirogon\u2019s ecosystem uses a state-of-the-art peer-to-peer network platform called LibP2P, a modular system of protocols, specifications, and libraries that enable the development of peer-to-peer network applications and is positioned to be the standard for future decentralized applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n Advantages\r\n\u2022Extensive research & value proposition to current blockchain limitations: The Whitepaper available on the Multi-chain website provides an in-depth yet accessible presentation of the responses provided by the team to solve current limitations on scalability, network efficiency, overall security, and reward fairness. CORE Multi-Chain Whitepaper accessible here.\r\n\u2022Security audits available: An audit of the network performed by CERTIK is currently public on the CORE Multi-Chain website. This research documents the project\u2019s performance in the following criteria: Security, Runtime, Documentation, Testing, General, and Transparency.  ",

        "description": "What Is Centric Swap (CNS)?\r\n\r\nCentric Swap (CNS) was first conceived in December 2017. CNS is a Binance Smart Chain-based token that serves as the Centric Network\u2019s on- and off-ramp. Centric Network itself is a dual-cryptocurrency payment network.\r\nCNS can be traded freely on cryptocurrency exchanges and offers users access to Centric Rise (CNR) along with liquidity. A decentralized protocol governs the exchange between these tokens and self-regulates the supply to meet the changes in demand.\r\nThe vision of Centric is to alleviate what they see as the largest obstacle to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, which is price volatility. The Centric Foundation was established to advance the adoption of Centric Rise (CNR) and Centric Swap (CNS).\r\nCentric has a dual-token model that rewards adoption and stabilizes over time due to its self-regulating supply. The idea behind the model is that, when a user purchases Centric Swap from a trusted cryptocurrency exchange, they can convert it to Centric Rise and benefit from its hourly growth.\r\nThis leads to the fact that at every moment when the Centric Rise is worth slightly more than Centric Swap, the user can convert CNR back to CNS and reap the rewards. This dual token system creates the conditions for a synthetic stable currency and can regulate the supply of Centric Rise to drive the market price of Centric Swap towards $1.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Centric Swap Unique?\r\n\r\nThe two tokens that make up the Centric dual-token model include the Centric Rise (CNR) and the Centric Swap (CNS).\r\nCNR trades at a fixed price and has hourly growth, while CNS trades at the price set by the market. At any point in time, Centric Rise can be redeemed for Centric Swap and vice versa.\r\nHolding Centric Rise grants a user predetermined hourly earnings on their investment in Centric Swap, ensured by the fact that the value of Centric Rise is constantly increasing in relation to Centric Swap. CNR trades at a predetermined price that is enforced by the Centric protocol and increases every hour when the protocol self-balances. 1 CNS will always convert to CNR at a fixed exchange rate of $1 USD of CNR.\r\nIn other words, Centric Rise (CNR) stores value, is a transactional currency, has a deflationary supply and an inflationary price and an hourly yield. Centric Swap (CNS) has liquidity, is traded on exchanges, has an elastic supply and a demand indicator. The Centric Protocol governs the token exchange, regulates the supply, is immutable, is censorship-resistant and is independently audited.\r\n\r\nHow Is the Centric Swap Network Secured?\r\n\r\nThe Centric Protocol is governed by the Centric Rise smart contract. CNR and CNS are based on the BSC blockchain\u2019s BEP20 standard.\r\nCentric Wallet is available where users can store their Centric Rise and Centric Swap. It has features that were specifically designed for these tokens.",

It works by letting fans invest in music and get a share of streaming profits, becoming an integral part of the journey from product creation to implementation.\r\n\r\nThe beta version of the platform was released in October 2019 and now has a 25 '000 user base. The essence of the Corite business model is as follows: thanks to the financial support of fans, artists can independently build their careers and earn money from their own work. Fans can even get involved in the creative process and promote their favorite music. Meanwhile, artists can fund and release their music through dedicated fandom. This scheme works due to the strong connection between artists and fans.\r\n\r\nIn July 2021, Corite entered the US market and partnered with Hitco to successfully close a US$2.2 million presale for their utility token $CO \u2013 the native currency of the Corite platform. Thus, Corite expanded their audiences, attracted a talented team and created a democratic working environment for artists. More recently, in January 2022, Corite also announced the closing of a \u20ac600K seed round for the European launch of its fan funding platform. The round was led by Tagehus, Eastate and Almi Invest.\r\n\r\nCorite works alongside a number of prominent music industry professionals such as L.A. Reid and Charles Goldstuck, founders of Hitco Entertainment, legendary producers Rico Love (Beyonce, Usher) and Konstantin Kersting (Dance Monkey, 4000 studios) and more. Recently, Corite completed a deal with Alan Walker to release multiple tracks and help bring the \"Walkerverse\" to Web3.\r\n\r\nIn January 2022, Corite CO succesfully completed a $ 6.2 million private token sale round to launch the upcoming blockchain platform.\r\n\r\nInvestors include NGC, CoinCO, Coin98, KuCoin labs, Chromaway, Gate labs, Kyros Venture, Shima Capital, Everse Capital, Rarestone Capital, NGC ",

The smartest people in the world are moving into Web3 \u2013 exiting FANG companies \u2013 and joining crypto companies or DAOs.\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\nConnex aims to build a permissionless, open, and collaborative Web3 professional network. The CONX token is an essential component to such infrastructures as it functions as the governance token, incentivizes user participation, and serves as the primary payment token of the Connex ecosystem. \r\nConnex is designed to reward high integrity and proof of fraud. CONX tokens are used to reward the platform users. CONX can be used for rewarding people who upload their CVs with high quality, or reward people who get most viewed and liked. The amount of CONX tokens rewarded will be determined through the voting and governance feature of the platform. People who create circles on Connex and share their valuable views about the circle topics are also welcomed by the platform.\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nPay for Subscription\r\nCONX is paid in exchange for subscribing a company or subscribe a SME in the field for talent recruitment and hiring purposes. This would allow them to view and like the CVs uploaded by users of Connex.\r\nPay for Credential\r\nCONX is paid in exchange for viewing personal on-chain and off-chain credentials of the users. Companies and SMEs may identify their candidates more easily and accurately with the platform\u2019s on-chain and off-chain labels.\r\nPay for Circle\r\nCONX is used for entering a professional circle, where they may share their valuable views on Circle topics. Users who share their views on Circle will be rewarded with CONX tokens. The amount of CONX tokens rewarded will be determined by tokenholders through the voting and governance feature of the Platform.\r\nPay for Exposure\r\nCONX is used for a better exposure of a company or people. Companies or SMEs may use their subscription of the Platform for marketing and branding purposes, such as to increase their exposure to users and to build their brands by providing users with details of their respective companies, including their products and services, vision and mission statements, job vacancy descriptions, reasons for joining their respective companies etc.\r\nGovernance\r\nCONX is used for voting & governance in Connex DAO, including voting on the fees to be paid by users, companies and SMEs to use the platform, the subscription fee to create and enter the Circle, the use of the tokens in the Community Treasure and the accuracy of a job or CV.\r\nIntegrity Assessment\r\nCONX can be staked against any job or credential on the platform to ensure and vouch for the credibility of the job or CVs for an exposure period. If the credibility of the job or CV is not challenged, then the tokenholder who staked the CONX tokens will be rewarded with more CONX tokens. However, if the credibility of the job or CV is challenged and the information therein is proved to be inaccurate, then the staked token will be burnt. The determination of the accuracy of the job or CV is conducted on-chain through the voting and governance feature of the Platform. While there may be plans to reward successful challengers of such job or CVs, and earn CONX tokens for such participation, this is in the process of being established and is currently not a feature of the platform. For the avoidance of doubt, the CONX tokens do not confer upon tokenholders any right to rewards by virtue of their holding of the CONX tokens only, but is a right to vouch for the credibility of a specific job or credentials on the platform on staking of the CONX tokens which, in turn, grants right to rewards on determination of the credibility of such job or credentials based on the exercise of voting rights and participation in platform governance by the tokenholders after their staking of the CONX tokens.\r\nCommunity Treasure\r\n20% of the total supply of the token will be distributed to the Community Treasure, which is intended to be used to reward users who boost the platform\u2019s growth and usage. For example, users will be rewarded when they recommend their friends, who have the capability and who are willing to work in the Web3 industry, to use the platform. Users who suggest new platform features to boost platform usage and smoothen the integration between the platform and other major talent hiring sites will also be rewarded. The amount of CONX tokens rewarded or decision on whether to adopt the new platform features will be determined by tokenholders through the voting and governance feature of the platform.\r\n",

It provides an unique incentive layer for the IPFS protocol and utilizes blockchain technology to enhancesecurity, privacy, performance and ownership of data.\r\n\r\nHow does the roadmap look like?\r\nThe mainnet launched on the 1st of September 2021 and currently holds a storage capacity of around 2,300 PetaBytes provided by more than 7,000 individual nodes.\r\nCrust Network already integrated with many blockchains and provides a fully decentralized storage layer for Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Solana, Near, Elrond, Heco and others. In the future Crust will implement its storage services for even more networks in order to provide its storage solutions for every ecosystem. Some of the biggest blockchain projects already use Crust Network to store their data or host their websites and dApps via Crust\u2019s infrastructure. These for example are Uniswap, AAVE or Polkadot Apps. In future, Crust Network is thriving to provide even more services for the Web3 and Web2 landscape for projects and companies to utilize and to build on. Crust's architecture also has the capability of supporting a decentralized computing layer and building a decentralized cloud ecosystem.\r\nCrust Ecosystem and Use Cases:\r\n\u2022 Providing the technical infrastructure for the Metaverse\r\n\u2022 Mint, Store and exchange NFTs fully decentralized\r\n\u2022 Hosting of Websites, dApps, Video streaming and more\r\n\u2022 Web 3.0 Gaming and decentralized social media\r\n\u2022 Personal Cloud storage to access your data from anywhere\r\n\u2022 File sharing and streaming services\r\n\r\nWhat are the CRU token utilities?\r\nCrust ($CRU) is a utility token within the Crust ecosystem which serves many different utilities. The most important utilities and functionalities of the CRU token are listed below:\r\n\u2022 Staking to maintain GPoS consensus\r\n\u2022 Collateral for storage providers to provide storage services\r\n\u2022 Used to cover transaction fees\r\n\u2022 Purchase storage or other cloud services\r\n\u2022 On-Chain governance mechanism\r\n\r\nCan I try Crust Networks storage solution?\r\nYes, you can enjoy the benefits of our networks in many ways. For example you can upload files to a fully decentralized Web 3.0 cloud solution on crustfiles.io where you can keep your data safe and always accessible. Just sign in with your Crypto wallet and enjoy storing your files in the\r\neasiest and most secure way possible. For NFT lovers, artists and collectors we also offer a decentralized NFT market platform where users can mint, store, trade and display their NFTs on a 100% decentralized infrastructure. Feel free to try out our NFT dedicated application on switchswap.io\r\n\r\nHow does Crust network compare to traditional cloud services?\r\nCompared to traditional and centralized storage providers like AWS, Google, Azure or Alibaba Cloud, Crust Network offers many advantages due to its decentralized infrastructure:\r\nAvailability: Crust eliminates the \u201cSingle-Point-of-Failure\u201d dilemma and the risk of downtime by on average creating 80 replicas distributed over individual nodes in the network. This maintains a high level of redundancy to keep your data always available and accessible.\r\nSecurity: High resistance against DNS hijack attempts or DDOS attacks. Additionally all data is encrypted by the IPFS protocol as well as Crust\u2019s TEE mechanism. Not even node operators or any other centralized organisation can access or tamper user data.\r\nPerformance: Due to many replicas on many nodes all over the world you can retrieve your files without any server-side bottlenecks. Data can be sourced and processed from many nodes at the same time to realize many benefits in regards of performance.\r\nCosts: Cloud storage costs on Crust Network are only 25-50 % of the costs compared to traditional Web 2.0 products on a centralized infrastructure. (Compared to\r\nAWS S3 Cloud Server)\r\n\r\nCan I start mining Crust?\r\nCrust network is a public and totally permission-less network that everybody can join at any time. Thanks to our MPoW (Meaningful Proof of Work) mechanism there is no need for expensive and energy consuming GPUs or high-end CPUs. All you need is a reliable internet connection, a CPU with TEE functionality and some free storage. For more information please refer to: https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/nodeOverview",

        "description": "What is CUDOS? \r\nCUDOS powers a decentralised compute network that will interoperate with multiple blockchain ecosystems to provide the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Trusted layer 1 validator network built on the Tendermint protocol - Wasm compatibility, for smart contracts to be deployed on CUDOS using next-generation languages so long as they compile to WebAssembly. I.e. Golang, Rust, Java etc.\r\n\r\n2. Cross-chain or Horizontal interoperability thanks to the network\u2019s Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) integration, allowing Cudos Network smart contracts to interface with multiple networks.\r\n\r\n3. 10x lower transaction and gas costs compared to those on PoW networks - A massively scalable network to facilitate more sophisticated smart contract operations\r\n\r\n4. Higher performance with anywhere between 200 to 500 Peak TPS on the network - access to a globally distributed layer 3 network of secure cloud, and compute, resources\r\n\r\nTuring complete solutions for non-Turing complete Layer 1 blockchain networks. With the underlying Cudo platform live in over 145 countries, across enterprise and edge environments, and used by over 250,000 users, CUDOS is the next major release, providing a decentralised computing layer bridging on-chain and off-chain resources.\r\n\r\nThe CUDOS token serves the following clear purposes: Transaction payments, Network governance and operations, a staking mechanism for receiving blockchain and cloud workloads, and a medium of exchange (MoE). \r\n\r\nWhat is CUDOS trying to solve? \r\nScaling on blockchain is both expensive and limited in the type of use-cases it can support. CUDOS solves this issue by providing a highly scalable Layer 2 and 3 solution, connecting both on-chain and off-chain consumers to the network via smart contracts and APIs. \r\n\r\nWho are the founders at CUDOS?\r\nCUDOS was founded by Mathew Hawkins, an award-winning entrepreneur, who previously founded C4L, a data center, cloud and network infrastructure provider that grew to support 1% of the UK\u2019s internet infrastructure. Exiting in 2016 for $30m, Mathew started Cudo and the CUDOS network to build infrastructure services in software, what he previously achieved in hardware. The executive team have backgrounds in building and scaling and SaaS with COO Lee Woodham, who has over 25 years split across scaling financial services and tech companies. The board of advisors also includes David Juxon, former MD of Bank of America, Chris Deering, Former President of Sony Entertainment (Playstation), Joerg Roskowetz, Director of Blockchain for AMD and Maggie Fang, early investor in Uber and Alibaba. \r\n\r\nWhat makes CUDOS unique? \r\nCUDOS is the first decentralised computing network to provide services to both on-chain and off-chain infrastructure consumers. Built on the Cosmos blockchain and utilising the Tendermint protocol for secure BFT consensus, the CUDOS validator network will provide a globally distributed and highly secure network able to allocate more intensive workloads out to the underlying Layer 3 Cudo platform. \r\n\r\nHow is the CUDOS network secured? \r\nThe CUDOS Network utilises the Byzantine Fault Tolerant Bonded Proof of Stake mechanism featured in the Cosmos SDK, known as Tendermint Core, as its consensus engine. Validators in the CUDOS network stake a given amount of CUDOS in order to earn fees from validating transactions on the network in a secure and highly reliable way. In order to achieve this, the CUDOS Network also leverages the Cosmos SDK\u2019s staking, slashing, and governance modules to incentivise a minimum of 95% uptime and to swiftly eliminate validators known to perform double-signs or other known forms of bad actor behaviours. \r\n\r\nWho are the major partners of CUDOS?\r\nCUDOS is partnered with major and recognised brands across both blockchain and enterprise computing verticals, including AMD, Ultra & Algorand. Strategic backers include Outlier Ventures (OV), Moonwhale, Moonrock, Brilliance Ventures, GBV, Spincrypto, Double Peak, Coinvision, and BMW Capital. \r\n\r\nHow many CUDOS coins are there in circulation?\r\nThere is a maximum supply of 10 billion CUDOS tokens released over a 10 year period (starting from the 11th January 2021). The total supply of 10 billion CUDOS is distributed via multiple allocations, with 34% Ecosystem & Community Development, 33.78% Reserve, 20% Team (2% released based per milestone achieved. 10 key pre-determined milestones), 5% Advisors and 7.22% to presale token holders. Use of funds will be as follows: 30% Research & Product Development, 10% Administration & Operations, 20% marketing, 10% CUDOS Validator Nodes (CVN), 13% User Acquisition, 10% Community Engagement and 7% Contingency. \r\n\r\nWhere can you buy CUDOS?\r\nAt the time of writing, the top exchanges for CUDOS trading are Ascendex, KuCoin, Gate.io, Uniswap, Bittrex Poloniex, CoinField, Liquid, ZT Global, and others.",

CyberVein is made to integrate the form of data economy in various aspects with the block chain technology as the core. Blockchain is the essence of a variety of technology integration into a State of a synchronous Machine (State Machine), using the characteristics of block chain technology to solve problems which cannot be solved in a traditional network. CyberVein also need to fully consider the model in the process of economics, architecture of applied mathematics, computer hardware and software technology. Its main purpose is to use the block chain technology to successfully serve the problem solving product/platform (BASS).\r\n\r\nThrough the analysis of the problems encountered in the design process of the existing blockchain technology, we also propose solutions to these problems. CyberVein is a underlying framework based on DAG and contains a programming language, the virtual machine, new smart contracts to build ecological chain system, the underlying blocks dedicated to and from the aspects of technical level and business level to solve the problem from the data value of the information age.\r\n\r\nThe business logic of CyberVein\r\n1. The value of passive data: passive data (such as Cookies) is not valuable in itself and only has the value to be exchanged.\r\n2. Definition of data exchange value: the exchange value of data needs to be defined by carrier and medium, which can be quantified to define data value and realize data transfer.\r\n3. The ownership of data: data is different from the ownership of the property rights and intellectual property rights. Data ownership is fundamentally to dominate the process of data, it can define the data owner distributing the data in detail, the capability of sharing, and delivered to the other party; At the same time, data ownership can also define the rights of data owners and tripartite users to create, edit, modify, share, and restrict access to data.\r\nThe three characteristics of CyberVein in the design of deep understanding and mining data can only improve the ecology of data value discovery.\r\n\r\nThe technical solutions of CyberVein\r\nCyberVein has the following technologies and innovative solutions proposed by multiple analysis to realize the design goal of CyberVein.\r\n1.A distributed ledger of DAG architecture.\r\n2.A smart contract programming language improved by CyberVein and a database virtual machine. \r\n3.A new consensus mechanism - PoC (Proof of Contribution)\r\n4.A new, inter-ecological smart contract architecture.\r\nOn the value of the data found in the process of using a DAG architecture of distributed books and a virtual machine with database functions, anyone can write the database and release smart contracts and Dapp, thus they can develop the data ownership of their value, data exchange format and data conversion function of rules.\r\n\r\nCyberVein programming language and virtual machine\r\nIn order to better achieve our smart contract outstanding performance, there are differences to the existing blockchain smart contracts. CyberVein will be in the development of the network at the same time, develop our own programming language Vein and Virtual Machine CBVM (CyberVein Virtual Machine). Vein language will take the Solidity as the foundation, at the same time, to improve the running mechanism with the help of some rich libraries about database operations, realize functions such as definition method call price. \r\nVein language will help in the existing smart contract writers blockchain migration, and CyberVein will release documents to help developers get started faster.\r\nCBVM defines the data value in ecological and metastasis, and provide safe and reliable high-performance smart contracts running environment. CyberVein virtual machine in addition to used to run the smart contract, will also be a database operation system. Unlike traditional database, the database in CBVM sandbox is more like a database, and the operation of each node of the virtual machine will have independent sandbox, ensure data or use condition does not affect chain is affected.\r\n\r\nCyberVein new consensus algorithm: Proof of Contribution\r\nCyberVein, like all blockchain technology, is driven by motivation of safe mode. In the traditional blockchain mining consensus, it is based on the choice of total difficulty of highest blocks. Miners and others to the blocks. In most of the consensus standards, only containing a given difficulty of work experience (PoW) of blocks are valid.\r\nThere\u2019s no mining mechanism in the DAG architecture because there is no miner concept. However, the existing DAG in the project before the release unit verification, most are using PoW and CyberVein will use our PoC mechanism is put forward.\r\nCyberVein contribution to prove: a response to block in the chain of the abuse of power or force concentrated and algorithm. PoC is based on the user's contribution to the network, add the appropriate hash calculation, to determine whether can win in the competition mechanism in the network. In traditional blockchain PoC can be used in the process of mining.\r\nIn each have the same hash miners work force, contribute more to the network resources miners (such as he contributed more hard disk capacity, or bandwidth, or power, etc.) will have smaller hash difficulty, so as to have more chance to beat competitors in the probability, acquired the right to the manufacture of new blocks.\r\nIn the DAG, when a user has more units under the condition of (he contributed more hard disk storage unit in the network), it will be more likely to reference the existing units, and obtain the corresponding fees.\r\nIOTA and Byteball projects in PoW validation of the role is mainly used to prevent the witch attacks and network to some extent abuse problems, and we believe that the use of PoC and other mechanisms, and can be done at the same time, encourage more users to participate in and contribution to the attack of prevention effect.",

These pawnbrokers are uniquely positioned in that they have a licensed and secure premises to store hard assets. They store the asset, issue an NFT representing it to the borrower, and then burn the NFT when the asset is reclaimed. Our dev team took inspiration from the UI of Booking.com to design the layout of featured crypto pawnshops on the platform. They also designed an on-chain reputation system for lenders and borrowers, which denotes how many transactions they have had and their record of integrity when using the platform.\r\n\r\nWe have developed an NFT marketplace with a special NFT Pawn Market integrated into it. This allows people to list NFTs for sale, auction, or pawn.

Even after leaving office, his influence continues to loom over the political landscape, spawning movements like \"Dark MAGA,\" characterized by an aggressive stance.\r\n\r\nDMAGA is a digital manifestation of this ethos. Launched on the Solana blockchain for its performance and low transaction costs, Solana's scalability and speed make it ideal for decentralized applications and assets, including political tokens like DMAGA. The coin's purpose goes beyond financial transactions, serving as a symbol of allegiance and a means of fundraising for Dark MAGA causes.\r\n\r\nA pivotal moment for DMAGA was the assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, when a highly publicized attempt on Donald Trump's life shocked the nation. This incident galvanized the Dark MAGA movement, intensifying their resolve and embedding their beliefs in the cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nDMAGA represents more than just a cryptocurrency; it is a digital emblem of a politically charged movement.

These districts are built upon a decentralized and distributed open-source framework, the d0xINFRA network, which is powered by Ethereum smart contracts. The district0x network aims at creating a friction-free, virtual economy where the users will be able to make buying and selling decisions, complete transactions, and even rank their peers with just one simple click. District0x aims to develop a flexible, and free market with advanced entrepreneurial concepts.\r\n\r\nThe District0x infrastructure has a very neat concept with some well-outlined features, such as the staking interface. A staking interface is put in place that allows DNT holders to have open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for all markets that come online. Post creation of a district, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can use to interact with this staking mechanism. After staking a user will receive voting rights in that district.  Using the creation interface, one can remove central power structures from any marketplace without the additional need for development or programming skills. It can be described as the WordPress of dApps where the districts being launched are like wordpress templates and the auxiliary modules are WordPress plugins for extended functionality.\r\n\r\nWhile it is very difficult to buy lesser known cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies (dollars, euros) directly from crypto-exchanges, district0x or DNT can be easily purchased from various exchanges using Ethereum or Bitcoin as the base cryptocoin. Binance is one of the popular exchange platforms that can help trade Bitcoin or Ethereum for District0x. One can use various wallets like myetherwallet.com to store the district0x (DNT) coins. Coinbase, Blockchain, Exodus, Trezor Hardware Wallet are also wallets that supports district0x.\r\n\r\nDistrict0x, differs from most coins in its underlying concept and the architecture it is built on. The concept of interconnected districts and marketplaces promises a novel structure to the modern economies. What a lot of users are missing out on is the fact that it is a staking mechanism and not just a voting token. Staking is basically the process of mining the PoS (proof of stake) coins. Early investors will be able to lock their tokens to a specific district on the network, thus being able to participate in its governance later. DNT tokens can be staked in districts, thus they not only give voting power and privileges within that district but also provide district-specific tokens depending on when the investor had started trading. For example, early investors of the PoS token will be able to make decisions about the distribution of profits among stakeholders, the intricacies of the business model etc. DNT can basically be considered as a dynamic stock in the future district0x ecosystem.\r\n\r\nBy joining the district0x, the user receives district0x coins. They allow the owner to exercise the right to vote for district proposals and make decisions within certain districts. This includes, for example, voting on proposals concerning the future of a particular district or setting fees. The scope of shareholders\u2019 rights is outlined in the bylaws and varies according to the specific scope and purpose of each district. District0x platform users can interact with the functions and services provided by each district. Users can also freely create their own districts. For example, on Ethlance, the first district in the District0x network, users can post job offers or search for new jobs.",

Introduced as a \"joke currency\" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. \r\n\r\nDogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.\r\n\r\nThe developers of Dogecoin haven\u2019t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.\r\n\r\nTo purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency. Once we have set up an account with a DOGE currency exchange and deposited some funds, you are ready to start trading. ",

The Outpost serves as a decentralized exchange hub where you can buy, sell, and trade your ships, cores, and other upgradeable Smart NFTs with fellow explorers. Use the marketplace to build limited edition ships and acquire other valuable collectible assets. Expand your fleet to enhance your exploration, harvesting, racing, and combat capabilities throughout the DEEPSPACE universe!\r\n\r\nPlayers can exchange land, weapons, spacecraft, and other items in the marketplace to aid their exploration of the game world.\r\n\r\nAs players advance in the game and grow their ship fleet, they can enhance their gameplay experience. The custom decentralized app (dapp) marketplace is integrated with the rest of the DEEPSPACE (DPS) platform, allowing for seamless connections between players looking to trade items and further their progress in the game.\r\n\r\nShip modifications, both temporary and permanent, can be transacted on the marketplace.\r\n\r\nDEEPSPACE - Game\r\nGame assets such as ships and equipment are blockchain NFTs, giving gamers full ownership of their in-game assets. Players can mint their own starships or purchase from the proprietary NFT marketplace, and choose up to 4 ships from their fleet to begin exploring, engaging, and discovering planets, places, and other players within the 3D space-based universe.\r\n\r\nRacing and Track Builder\r\nIn addition to exploration and combat, DEEPSPACE features exhilarating racing mechanics! Players can participate in high-speed races across various cosmic tracks. The innovative track builder allows you to create your own custom racetracks, designing loops, jumps, and obstacles to challenge yourself and your friends. Share your tracks with the community and compete for the fastest times!\r\n\r\nStarship Archetypes\r\nFour starship archetypes allow you to explore the universe openly, engage in combat, or mine resources:\r\n\r\n1. Fighters - Ships with state-of-the-art weapon technology.\r\n2. Tank - Ships designed for managing enemy engagements, longevity, and withstanding damage.\r\n3. Mining - Ships specially engineered for efficient resource collection.\r\n4. Support - Ships focused on utility and boosting the capabilities of your other ships.\r\n\r\nEach ship has its own benefits in the form of 8 different stats: attack, special attack, shields, special defense, speed, luck, mining, and health.\r\n\r\nPlayers can apply permanent and temporary modifications as they play. Modifications allow for many added battle benefits, situational adaptability, and other stat improvements. Temporary modifications give players single-use bonuses during gameplay with specific uses and unique outcomes.\r\n\r\nResource mining allows players to gather raw materials, like ore, for ship or property add-ons and modifications. Mined materials enable you to customize your ships, creating a unique experience for every player.\r\n\r\nBattles and Challenges\r\nBattles occur frequently within the game and can take one of two forms:\r\n\r\n1. Player vs Player (PvP) - PvP allows players to battle against each other for prizes, leaderboard placement, and bragging rights.\r\n2. Player-vs-Enemy (PvE) - PvE involves battling Non-Playable Characters (NPCs; i.e., game-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) players) throughout the game as a mechanism for winning rewards and enhancing your gameplay experience.\r\n\r\nDive into the DEEPSPACE universe today and embark on your adventure filled with exploration, racing, and epic battles!",

        "description": "What is MultiversX \r\n\r\nMultiversX is a blockchain protocol that offers true horizontal scalability by using all aspects of sharding (Network, Transaction & State). The project describes itself as a technology ecosystem for the new internet, which includes decentralized finance, real world assets and the Metaverse. Its smart contracts execution platform is reportedly capable of up to 100,000 transactions per second, 6-second latency and a $0.002 transaction cost. MultiversX is governed and secured through the EGLD token. EGLD, or Electronic Gold, is MultiversX's native token. It acts as a store of value currency to pay for network usage. The coin also serves as a medium of exchange between platform users and validators. Users pay transaction fees in EGLD and validators participate in the consensus process. EGLD allows developers to deploy smart contracts, protocols, and dApps on the platform. It empowers participants to perform any network action. Through staking and validation rewards, as well as transaction fees, EGLD manages the MultiversX network. Plus, EGLD is endowed with the functionality of a governance token, so its holders can vote on network decisions. \r\n\r\nHow does MultiversX Work \r\n\r\nAccording to the MultiversX crypto team, the project implements three types of parallelization: state, transactions, and network, using the parallel processing method to speed up the time and increase the number of transactions. MultiversX uses Adaptive State Sharding to scale while sharing infrastructure to support a growing number of applications/transactions on the ledger. A variation of the traditional PoS operational protocol guarantees the connection to the platform of all sections of the network, separated during sharding. Hence, the integrated environment is involved in the development of dApps, which are imitations of products and services. MultiversX combines three sharding methods to create its own unique adaptive one. It divides the network into four shards: three being execution shards that process transactions, validating 30,000 transactions per second, and Metachain is the fourth shard that coordinates and completes transactions. Sharding types include: State sharding where the history of the network, or state, is distributed across different sections of the network, or shards. Segments have their own ledger, nodes store the state of each segment; Transaction sharding where transactions are mapped to segments and processed, segments process transactions in parallel and nodes capture the state of the entire network; Network sharding where the nodes are grouped into segments and then processed. Network slicing contributes to optimizing communications. \r\n\r\nWhat makes MultiversX Unique \r\n\r\nMultiversX describes itself as a blockchain platform for the new internet economy, decentralized applications and enterprise use. Its main selling point is its high scalability, stating that it is the first blockchain network in which state, network and transaction sharding have all been implemented. According to its economics paper, it seeks to build up its ecosystem and establish EGLD as a store-of-value asset. To achieve this goal, the network runs on 3,200 validator nodes split into four shards: three execution shards, capable of up to 100,000 transactions per second in total, and one coordination shard, the \"Metachain.\" MultiversX's adaptive state sharding architecture completely shards state, transactions and network. It can scale by adding additional shards when the throughput demand requires. It was tested to run 263,000 TPS in a public environment with 1,500 nodes from 29 countries grouped in 50 shards. To increase adoption, the blockchain also supports developers building on the platform, allowing them to earn 30% of the smart contract fees as royalties.\r\n",

Enigma wants to extend Ethereum Smart Contracts by introducing secret contracts, a brand of smart contract that gives users an element of privacy that\u2019s not intrinsic to current blockchain protocols. These contracts operate off-chain, meaning the execution of the Smart Contract doesn\u2019t occur on the Ethereum blockchain itself. This is how the Enigma protocol works: it breaks up the Smart Contract and any related data into pieces, encrypts those pieces, and distributes them redundantly among Enigma nodes.\r\n\r\nEnigma has a protocol level. The Enigma privacy protocol allows for decentralized computation of sensitive data. It has a platform layer too. On this protocol, dozens of platforms such as data marketplaces and AI exchanges can be built. In its application layer, it enables thousands of truly decentralized apps that require private computation and secure data.Its first application is catalyst. Catalyst is the first application to be built on the Enigma protocol, already active with tens of thousands of users. Catalyst is a revolutionary platform for data-driven cryptoasset investing and research, built for professional crypto traders.\r\n\r\nEnigma has a team of MIT graduates, and they\u2019ve been working diligently to ensure Enigma\u2019s success. Guy Zyskind, Enigma\u2019s CEO and cofounder, helped start the project while he was still a student at MIT. He has more than a decade of software development experience with an M.S. from MIT. Sandy Pentland, a well known MIT data scientist who gained fame for his work in data-mining social interactions, is Zyskind and Nathan\u2019s adviser on Enigma. With other advisors such as Alex Pentland, who sits on the Advisory Boards for Google and Nissan, CEO of Abra, Bill Barhydt and director of MIT media lab, Prof. Alex Pentland, it is hard to difficult a fault in the team.",

ENS also supports \u2018reverse resolution\u2019, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.\r\n\r\nENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet\u2019s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by the Ethereum blockchain. Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.\r\n\r\nTop-level domains, like \u2018.eth\u2019 and \u2018.test\u2019, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their subdomains. Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use. ENS also supports importing in DNS names already owned by the user for use on ENS.\r\n\r\nBecause of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired. For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.\r\n\r\nENS is deployed on the Ethereum main network and on several test networks. If you use a library such as the ensjs Javascript library, or an end-user application, it will automatically detect the network you are interacting with and use the ENS deployment on that network.",

In the world of traditional finance, this process is typically facilitated by trusted and permissioned third-parties such as banks, who connect people with a surplus of money to those who need access to it in the short term. In the world of decentralised finance (DeFi), trusted and permissioned third-parties are no longer needed; banks have been replaced by trustless and permissionless lending protocols running on the blockchain (1).\r\nAmong the first-generation of DeFi lending protocols are Compound (2) and Aave (3). These protocols provide users with access to lending and borrowing capabilities for a handful of the most liquid ERC20 tokens. However, these protocols were not designed to handle the risks associated with lending and borrowing illiquid or volatile assets and have therefore relied on a permissioned listing system to protect their users from the risks associated with such assets.\r\nConsequently, there remains significant unmet demand for lending and borrowing the long tail of crypto assets. On the lending side, users want to deposit tokens to earn yield and take leveraged long positions. On the borrowing side, users want to reduce their exposure to volatility and take leveraged short positions. Here, we present Euler: a permissionless lending protocol custom-built with an array of new features to help users lend and borrow more types of tokens than ever before.",

After some consideration, I decided to give it a try and create one.\r\n\r\nHe explained the best approach for a successful token, and after doing my homework, I asked Grok to write a simple ERC-20 token with no tax. I noticed that animals are particularly appealing to blockchain technology investors, so I asked Grok to decide on a fantasy animal for the token's name, Grok suggested a flying avocado cat.. so be it.\r\n\r\nI added proof of Groks decision and contract creation, as I figured out there are many fake cryptocurrencies that claim to be Groks creation. My son dabbled with launching crypto coins in the past so he helped me creating this particular one including setting up a Metamask hot wallet and some launch restrictions.\r\n\r\nAfter further research I came to the conclusion I would need to set apart some coins for potential future collaborations with big platforms that list tokens. Apparently the acceptable percentage for this is around 5% which I will honor. The rest will go to the token itself. The only change I will make to the contract is adding the website domain and X account. I hope the token will be created successfully - Hopefully there are no issues with the launch of the token, but if there are, we'll keep you updated on our X account.\r\n\r\nI'll open an X account for it to communicate further on updates.

On one hand, horny desperation, realized through the ubiquity of social media and modern dating culture. On the other, bravery in the face of social norms \u2013 an embrace of feminine confidence and a rejection of the thinspo culture that promotes body dysmorphia. \r\n\r\nDoes he care that the woman is much larger than he? Perhaps, in fact, he likes it. Or, nihilistically, he doesn\u2019t care one way or the other \u2013 he is motivated not out of desperation or attraction, but depression and anxiety. \r\n\r\nAnd what of the woman?

It's\r\nnot just about the meme; it's about the story, the recognition, and the\r\ncommunity's belief in something that's both absurd and, in the crypto world,\r\npotentially profitable.\r\n\u2022 The Fluffington Phenomenon: From the posts on X, there's a sentiment that\r\n$FLUFFI could be the next big thing, partly because of its association with\r\nGrok. This isn't about Fluffington being a part of Grok's programming or\r\nanything that technical; it's more about cultural osmosis. Grok's rebellious\r\nspirit, its humor, and its willingness to tackle spicy questions have somehow\r\nfound a mascot in Fluffington, making it a symbol of the kind of Al and\r\ncommunity interaction Musk envisioned.\r\nSo, what's Fluffington's relation to Grok? It's not a direct relation in terms of tech or\r\nfunctionality. Instead, think of Fluffington as:\r\n\u2022 A Meme Spirit Animal: It embodies the spirit of what Grok stands for in the\r\ncultural landscape of Al and internet culture.\r\n\u2022 A Symbol of Rebellion: Against the overly serious, overly cautious Al\r\nmodels, Fluffington, with its meme status, represents the playful,\r\nunpredictable side of Al interaction that Grok champions.\r\n\u2022 A Crypto Meme with Legs: In the crypto world, where narratives drive value,\r\nFluffington's story with Grok adds layers of intrigue, making it not just\r\nanother meme coin but a symbol of a movement towards more human,\r\nhumorous Al interactions.",

Our mission is to build a consensus driven map of the world, empowering a fully decentralized web3 economy with verifiable location data. FOAM incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving and fraud-proof location verification. The starting point for FOAM is static proof of location, where a community of Cartographers curate geographic Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven efforts, FOAM\u2019s dynamic proof of location protocol will enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network of radio beacons that is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure location verification services.\r\n\r\nFOAM Token Functionality\r\n1. Add and Curate Geographic Points of Interest\r\nThe FOAM Spatial Index Visualizer allows Cartographers to participate in interactive TCR POIs on a map. Users can add points to the map, validate new candidates and verify the map by visiting real world locations. The FOAM Token Curated Registry unlocks mapping in a secure and permissionless fashion and allows locations to be ranked and maintained by token balances. Users can deposit FOAM Tokens into POIs on the map to increase attention those POIs might receive.\r\n\r\n2. Signal for Zone Incentivisation\r\nA further potential use of the FOAM Token by Cartographers is to stake their FOAM Tokens to Signal. Signaling is a mechanism designed to allow Cartographers to incentivize the expansion and geographic coverage of the FOAM network. To Signal, a Cartographer stakes FOAM Tokens to a Signaling smart contract by reference to a particular area. These staked tokens serve as indicators of demand, and are proportionate to (i) the length of time staking (the earlier, the better), and (ii) the number of tokens staked (the less well-served areas, the better). In the context of the contingent Dynamic Proof of Location concept (described further in the Product Whitepaper), these indicators are the weighted references that determine the spatial mining rewards.\r\n\r\n3. Contribute to Potential Secure Location Services as Zone Anchor or Verifier\r\nThe FOAM protocol may allow users to provide work and secure localization services and location verification for smart contracts and be rewarded for their own efforts with new FOAM Tokens in the form of mining rewards. Devices and real world contracts can be programmed to designate attestations and track interactions and transactions on the map. With the addition of necessary radio hardware by individual users and the grass roots expansion of the FOAM network, it may be possible for location status to be proved in a different manner. Location could be proved through a time synchronization protocol that would ensure continuity of a distributed clock, whereby specialized hardware could synchronize nodes\u2019 clocks over radio to provide location services in a given area. As explained further in the following paragraph, this \u2018Dynamic Proof of Location\u2019 is contingent on a number of factors outside of Foamspace\u2019s control.",

Member NFT holders propose and vote on either the launch of new or the re-launch of existing memecoins on FMBC, by contributing to their launch liquidity pools. Launches are fully automated, decentralized, and created with liquidity farming, LPT staking, and LPT farming. This approach grants memecoins launched on FMBC instant utility and maximized sustainability. Once the minimum required for a memecoin launch pool has been staked by members (LPs), the pool is automatically created on a leading DEX like Uniswap and then shared with non-club members of our herd and the general public. Memecoins are immediately distributed to LP's wallets without any lockups or vesting. Smart contracts are audited, and ownership is renounced with zero possibility of a rug pull.\r\n",

Active node operators may earn rewards in FORT from the Network if they maintain the minimum stake and emit alerts and execute their assigned work correctly.\r\n\r\n2) Delegated staking: FORT holders have the possibility to delegate to scan node pools. This action improves the security of the network and enables delegators to participate in the rewards distribution. \r\n\r\n3) Minimum Bot Stake Requirement.

FUSION was established by the CEO of BitSE, an incubation company which developed QTUM Blockchain and the VeChain blockchain, crypto projects which are both successful. Fusion uses the Hierarchical Hybrid Consensus Mechanism (HHCM) that borrows things from PoW and PoS. At the same time, it uses a parallel computing by grouping nodes together, creating an efficient and safe platform.\r\n\r\nThe Fusion team used in its whitepaper the term Internet of Values which refers mostly to cryptocurrency related matters, such as the exchange and management of digital assets securely and without intermediaries. The Distributed Control Right Management is a security layer that protects all locked-in cryptocurrency assets on the Fusion blockchain. The distributed storage and sharding of a private key ensures that no one can have access the complete private key, meaning that no single node can gain control of the digital assets. Along with the traditional transaction triggering mechanism, FUSION incorporated time and event based triggers into its smart contracts. These three triggering modes have resulted from various financial situations, and have been designed to meet the requests of complex financial smart contracts.\r\n\r\nBitSE, the company behind the Fusion Project, was founded in 2013 by Dejun Qian, being also responsible for the creation of QTUM and VeChain. QTUM and VeChain are both blockchain foundations which developed into independent ventures. The native token of the Fusion platform, FSN, will be used in paying network fees. Smart contracts require FSN in order for them to be executed, much like how ETH is used in the Ethereum network.

Using the Gems Protocol, anyone can tap into the power of scalable micro task workers without needing to worry about task verification, trust, or payments. Gems is designed to disincentivize malicious actors and reward fair players. The Gems Protocol is comprised of a staking mechanism to ensure task completion, a trust mechanism to track worker integrity, and a payment system to reduce transaction fees. The GEM token, a multi-utility token, fuels the Gems Protocol. Gems uses its token mechanism to enforce the behavior of all participants, instead of being regulated by a single operator.\r\n\r\nGems Protocol, aptly named the Gems Platform. The Gems Platform connects those who want work done (henceforth known as \u201crequesters\u201d) and human workers (henceforth known as \u201cminers\u201d). By using the Gems Protocol, the Gems Platform removes socioeconomic barriers that exist in centralized alternatives (e.g. large fees, market inefficiencies, need for bank accountants, etc.).

The team at AIG comprises of crypto-technology and blockchain enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nAndy saw potential in designing a decentralized network powered by the Ethereum blockchain to fix the current broken content monetization model with a better model. Most people introduced to the global content industry will identify the following problems with the current model:\r\nThe Gifto network was launched in December 2017 and has been tested along with AIG\u2019s flagship product, Uplive.  Uplive is a live streaming mobile application with over 20 million users.\r\n\r\nAn official Gifto report in February 2018, stated that Gifto featured in the top 10 traded cryptocurrencies by volume. The universal blockchain-based virtual gifting protocol has not only bridged the gap between content creators and the audience but has also introduced a way to acknowledge and reward the content creators. Besides monetizing decentralized content, it has revamped the modern creator-audience relationship.\r\n\r\nIt has already received support from a number of large institutional investors including KPCB and Wicklow Capital. This can only be seen a positive for Gifto as it proves that the idea has been scrutinized and accepted by a fairly large number of people.",

        "description": "What is Gomining Protocol?\r\n\r\nGoMining is a Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate protocol.\u00a0\r\n\r\nGomining allows users to own Bitcoin hashrate digitally as an NFT asset on the Ethereum/BNB chains and the Bitcoin blockchain (ordinals) without the necessity to own or maintain their physical mining infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIt simplifies Bitcoin mining for millions of users and unlocks the huge potential of Bitcoin hashrate to be used as RWA (Real World Asset) in Defi.\r\n\r\nThe hashrate NFT position continuously generates Bitcoins and can be traded or used as collateral in Defi like any other asset. To make this possible, Gomining created and developed the Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate (LBH) concept: while the physical mining equipment and the corresponding hashrate operate in the data center, the user owns an NFT that represents the hashrate position.\r\n\r\nThe LBH tokens can be used in Defi like Ethereum-based LSTs (liquid staking tokens) : they generate income on behalf of their owner, can be traded, and can be used in Defi protocols for borrowing/lending purposes. For example, LBH tokens can be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins for farming strategies and providing additional income to the LBH token owner. In addition to using NFTs for bitcoin mining or Defi-related activities, NFT owners can participate in play-to-earn mechanics that enrich the NFT-based mining experience, engage the community, and provide additional income to NFT owners. Gomining actively develops GameFi elements that allow users to generate additional income in NFTs on top of primary BTC mining proceeds.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Gomining token?\r\n\r\nThe design of GoMining token combines a Discount token, a modified version of the burn and mint equilibrium (BME)\u00a0[2]\u00a0[3], and ve Token (voter escrowed) governance model\u00a0[4].\r\n\r\nThe GOMINING token has the following functions within the Gomining ecosystem:\r\n\r\nDiscount token for electricity payments. NFT hashrate owners are required to pay electricity and maintenance costs, which are deducted from BTC mining revenue. By using the Gomining token for power/maintenance payments, users receive a 10% discount and continuously mine more bitcoins.\r\n\r\nProtocol governance. Users participating in Gomining governance can vote on proposals, influence protocol management, and most importantly - Gomining rewards distribution to the community of NFT owners and GameFi activities. Participation in governance requires locking tokens into a veGMT contract, which works identically to the well-known veCRV (vote-escrowed Curve contract).\r\n\r\nUsers who lock Gomining tokens in a vote-escrow (ve) contract receive (1) votes and (2) stake rewards. The longer the lock, the greater the number of votes and shares in the reward distribution for a given number of locked Gomining tokens.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Discount Token Utility and Governance Utility, token holders can upgrade the hashrate and energy efficiency of their Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate positions using Gomining tokens.\r\n\r\nHow Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate NFTs are issued?\r\n\r\nLiquid Bitcoin Hasrate NFTs are issued by Service Providers using Gomining. The requirements for Service Providers include: (1)to have public hashrate proof in known BTC mining pools (2) membership in reputable mining organizations such as the\u00a0Bitcoin Mining Council. In the future, Gomining aims to launch its own BTC mining pool and require Service Providers to use it for even more transparency.\r\n\r\nHow Gomining community rewards are allocated?\r\n\r\nThe Gomining community distributes rewards via weekly voting, which requires locking Gomining tokens into a vote-escrow contract (veGMT) to receive votes.\r\nHow to buy and use hashrate NFT for BTC mining?\r\n\r\nUsers can buy NFTs on the\u00a0Gomining website\u00a0or NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. When the NFT is in the wallet balance, the user should visit the\u00a0Gomining website, connect the wallet, and provide the BTC wallet address to receive the mining proceeds. The more efficient mining strategy involves using GMT tokens to pay for electricity and maintenance costs. GMT tokens can be purchased on various CEX exchanges,\u00a0Uniswap (Ethereum),\u00a0PancakeSwap (the BNB chain), or on the\u00a0Gomining website\u00a0that integrates all purchase options on one page.\r\nGomining token circulation mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe Gomining token uses the burn-and-mint equilibrium model (BME) to circulate within the ecosystem. It works as follows: all tokens paid by users for electricity/maintenance costs and some other activities are burned, and immediately, new Gomining tokens are minted by a smart contract.\r\n\r\nThe burning and minting process is based on epochs and minting coefficients. Each epoch has a number of tokens to be burned and minted according to a certain mining coefficient that increases from epoch to epoch. The total number of Epochs is 20, here we share some highlights:\r\n\r\nEpoch 0: 10,000,000 tokens burnt, 8,000,000 tokens minted, 0.80 coefficient\r\nEpoch 1: 20,000,000 tokens burnt, 16,200,000 tokens minted, 0.81 coefficient\r\nEpoch 2: 30,000,000 tokens burnt, 24,600,000 tokens minted, 0.82 coefficient\r\nEpoch 17: 750,000,000 tokens burnt, 727,500,000 tokens minted, 0.97 coefficient\r\nEpoch 18: 1,345,762,000 tokens burnt, 1,318,846,760 tokens minted, 0.97 coefficient\r\nEpoch 19 (the Final Epoch): the infinite number of tokens can be burned and minted with a 0.99 coefficient\r\n\r\nThe minted tokens are distributed to:\u00a0\r\nService Providers (hashrate NFT issuers) for compensating their electricity/maintenance costs (65%)\r\nGovernance stakers (20%)\r\nRewards and incentives for the NFT owners and GameFi activities (10%)\r\nThe team (5%)",

Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.\r\n\r\nHolochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between users.\r\n\r\nHolochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nHolochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain\u2019s fledgling system, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.\r\n\r\nThis system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use and similarity to C. Dapps written specifically for Holochain can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.\r\n\r\nThe developers added that Holochain is relatively flexible when it comes to handling new languages, so there is potential for growth on that front. Holochain bills itself as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Because there is no need for each individual agent to store and validate the global blockchain, Holochain only consumes a fraction of the bandwidth of traditional chains. Holochain also does not have a mining component, so there\u2019s no electricity or processing power spent on proof-of-work calculations.\r\n\r\nArthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun are the co-founders of Holochain and creators of Holochain. They have been designing alternatives currencies since the 80\u2019s and have been working on Holu since before the Bitcoin whitepaper was written. To protect the incentives of users, founders and developers, Holochain is owned by a non-profit foundation. he company\u2019s advisory team also includes Ryan Bubinski, the co-founder of CodeAcademy. In June, Holochain announced a new strategic partnership with Promether, an Adaptive Symbiotic Platform (ASP) that implements all the networking, security and anonymization code applications need to protect their data.",

The Huobi Token (HT) rewards exchange users for their loyalty with lowered transaction fees while also carrying its own value in tradable pairs against popular currencies. The hope was to bring greater value to Huobi\u2019s millions of users, mostly located in Asian countries. The launch of the Huobi Token follows in the footsteps of other loyalty-building tokens that other exchanges have launched. The first and most successful of these tokens has been Binance Coin (BNB). The creation of BNB secured Binance\u2019s place as the world\u2019s leading exchange. It offered discounted trading fees in exchange for customer loyalty, primarily functioning as a loyalty rewards system.\r\n\r\nHuobi officially announced its intentions to launch a new token on January 22, 2018. Over the course of 15 days, Huobi would distribute 300 million HT (60% of the total supply) to its pro users who purchased a discounted service package. Each morning, a new batch of HT would become available on a first come, first served basis. Huobi declared this token distribution scheme, \u201cnot an ICO,\u201d due to the nature of the offering. Users are buying a specific service package, part of which includes HT that give a discount toward trading fees. The exchange launched the Huobi Token as part of an overall strategy to recover its user base after tightening regulations in China severely restricted cryptocurrency trading. In an interview with CoinDesk, Leon Li, Huobi\u2019s founder, revealed that Chinese rule changes had decimated the trading volume on Huobi by 95% between September 15 and November 1, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe HT token distribution began on January 24 and wrapped up on February 7, 2018. Each day of the distribution, millions of tokens sold out in mere minutes after going on sale. At that point, 300 million HT had been distributed to Huobi Pro members who bought packages. That\u2019s 60% of the total supply currently in public circulation. Another 200 million HT, 40% of the total supply, was set aside. 20% goes toward user rewards and platform operation. The other 20% is vested for four years and constitutes the team reward.\r\n\r\nHuobi isn\u2019t the first exchange to issue its own token. Binance (BNB), Bibox (BIX), KuCoin (KCS) and Coss (COSS) have all issued their own tokens as well.",

This will enhance participation.  \r\nHydra uses the DragonX vault: Possibly the most distinct and important element to Hydra is its mechanism for burning TitanX. Rather than using a standard burn by sending tokens to the dead address, Hydra sends its burned TitanX to the DragonX vault, increasing the DragonX share of the TitanX Ethereum payouts. \r\nHydra burns DragonX directly: The Hydra protocol sets aside a percentage of the TitanX used to start miners to burn DragonX off the market. This reduced the supply of DragonX forever it also makes the DragonX based buy and burn more effective. \r\nHydra favors short compounding cycles: Unlike Hyper and TitanX which gave bonuses to early adopters, Hydra favors users that compound their proceeds over time.

        "description": "The first two Impossible Finance products revolve around yield & autonomous community creation. Versus TradFi\u2019s low yields, defi yield protocols have been a killer app, but impermanent loss still looms large. Instead, focusing on low-IL asset pools such as EUR and JPY stablecoins, where central banks have negative interest rates, or non-dividend yielding synthetics (hint: high growth stocks don\u2019t have dividends) like synthetic TSLA, we propose the first wave of \u201cImpossible Yield\u201d products powered by our stablecoin swap, StableXswap. Taking a page out of Aave & Synthetix\u2019 playbook, this also encourages us to integrate many synthetic assets, lending protocols, and cross-chain solutions to aggregate liquidity. This yield generated from stable EUR, JPY, or TSLA pools is unbeatable by TradFi, at least until the ECB changes policies, the Japanese population pyramid inverts, or Elon Musk changes his website\u2019s FAQ.\r\n\r\nIn early 2021, we saw Wall Street Bets clash with Robinhood & hedge funds, putting emphasis on addressing retail users\u2019 needs without sacrificing user autonomy. Beyond avoiding business models that actively harm users (i.e. selling flow to frontrunners, or hiding spreads to mask fees), why would you ever accept dividendless holdings when defi can give you yield? That\u2019s Impossible Finance: we\u2019re hellbent on providing better financial instruments for the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second release of Impossible Finance products tackle crypto\u2019s best killer app: fundraising. In the wake of 2017 ICO scams, Vitalik posited DAICOs, (DAO + ICOs), where project teams could raise smart- contract vested funds, provided they achieve certain milestones. Governors determined whether the team was still building, or else refund investors. However, 2018 lacked robust governance and voting portals (i.e.snapshot.page), let alone real products to invest in. Today, we propose the launch of self-sustaining- initial-dex-offerings, or SSIDOs. With the power of yield from our AMMs and partner protocols, a team that raises $10M with a $2M burn rate can be self-sustaining with just 20% APY, creating a new raise once, build forever model. The Andre\u2019s of the world can find capital & liquidity and no longer need to rely on cexes and rent-seeking private investment funds to pay the bills. Meanwhile, vesting stable LP tokens from the fundraise stay within our AMM, which creates sticky TVL. Teams that raise via this system get automatically transparent banking, while traders get access to steady liquidity, anti-rugpull peace of mind. Our mission at Impossible Finance will be to continue finding win-wins for traders, investors, projects, and protocols alike.",

Each IMMO token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. mcUSD) in the Immortal treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Immortal also introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding. \r\n\r\nImmortalDAO is also considered an algorithmic currency protocol with the goal of becoming a stable crypto-native currency within the Celo ecosystem. Though sometimes called an algorithmic stablecoin, ImmortalDAO is more akin to a central bank since it uses reserve assets like mcUSD to manage its price. The goal is to achieve price stability while maintaining a floating market-driven price. The biggest difference between IMMO and stablecoins like USDC is that IMMO is backed but not pegged to a particular price. Technically, the price floor for IMMO is 1 mcUSD, but practically a premium and the treasury value is added to the price. IMMO differs from other algorithmic stablecoins like Ampleforth (AMPL) because it issues IMMO to buy mcUSD and other assets and maintain a treasury. This mechanism is similar to FEI; the key difference is that FEI keeps a dollar peg, and ImmortalDAO Finance allows its token to float.\r\n\r\nIMMO is the native utility token that is used for staking and bonding on our decentralised Application (https://www.immortaldao.finance/) as well as governance votes to determine how network resources are allocated.",

It\u2019s a  celebration of an apex predator relayed over zoomer vibes. \r\n\r\nThe cult emphasizes the effervescent glow up, ambition, and relentlessly rising to the top. \r\n\r\nIt is a play on words for the \"IRS\" but in no way shape or form connected to the governmental body, the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe decentralized nature of governance in the Iridescent Rabbit Shark (IRS) community mirrors the broader principles of blockchain technology by allowing its community to engage in decision-making processes. This approach reflects a democratic ethos akin to blockchain governance, where transparency and inclusivity are paramount.  However, IRS, while innovative in its governance model, remains relatively obscure with a limited market presence. Its small market cap and high volatility could indicate a higher investment risk due to its niche status and the speculative nature of such decentralized projects.\r\n",

There will also be live auctions held in the metaverse shop for items of high value worth.\r\n\r\n- Jade Currency & Tokenomics\r\nThe JADE token will act as a fractional ownership token. Public holders are taking majority ownership of 60% of transactions fees from the marketplace, fees from the NFT sale in Metaverse, live auction fees and most importantly, own 60% of the LAND value and metaverse shop.

        "description": "What Is KlimaDAO?\r\nKlimaDAO is building the infrastructure for a transparent, neutral, and public Digital Carbon Market to accelerate climate finance on a global scale.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, KlimaDAO traded over $4 billion worth of carbon credit trade while growing treasury assets to over $100 million.\r\n\r\nWho uses KlimaDAO?\r\nAs the base layer infrastructure for the Digital Carbon Market, KlimaDAO powers platforms such as Carbonmark, the universal carbon market, and works with organizations such as Polygon, Circle, and the Liechtenstein Bankers Association to help organizations such as airlines, auto companies, banks, Web3 projects, and individuals such as Mark Cuban to meet their sustainability goals.\r\n\r\nA brief history of KlimaDAO\r\nKlimaDAO was founded in 2021 by a group of individuals from three competing organizations who had been working to solve market failures in the traditional Voluntary Carbon Market. These founding Core contributors aimed to unite their diverse experience \u2013 in carbon markets, technology, and business strategy and execution \u2013 as part of a single mission, in order to solve bottlenecks in scaling climate finance globally.\r\n\r\nKlimaDAO has since grown to assemble the talents of over 50 contributors, and over 100,000 KLIMA token holders.\r\n\r\nIn 2022 KlimaDAO launched its carbon retirement aggregator, enabling individuals and organizations to permissionlessly offset their carbon footprints. One of its landmark early users was the Polygon Network, which used KlimaDAO\u2019s infrastructure to retire over 100,000 digital carbon credits to go carbon neutral. Brands such as Instagram, Nike, and Bentley chose to build with Polygon due to its leadership in sustainability. \r\n\r\nIn March 2023 Carbonmark launched as the go-to platform for acquiring, trading, and retiring digital carbon. Carbonmark offers a seamless \u2018Web 2.5\u2019 user experience, enabling institutional access to tens of millions of carbon credits, and to KlimaDAO\u2019s digital carbon infrastructure, without additional fees.",

Projects can build on top of Kyber to utilize all the services offered by the protocol, such as the instant settlement of tokens, liquidity aggregation, and a customizable business model.\r\n\r\nKyber looks to solve the liquidity issue in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry by allowing developers to build products and services without having to worry about liquidity for different needs. \r\n\r\nThe Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) token is a utility token that is the \"glue that connects different stakeholders in Kyber's ecosystem.\" KNC holders can stake their tokens in the KyberDAO to help govern the platform and vote on important proposals \u2014 and earn staking rewards in Ethereum (ETH) that come from trading fees. \r\n\r\nWhat Makes Kyber Network Unique?\r\nKyber Network is the first tool that allows anyone to instantly swap tokens without the need of a third-party, like a centralized exchange.

Originally conceived in 2020, Koinos was officially launched November 5th, 2022 by Koinos Group, a US company.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo learn more about this project, check out koinos.io.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike other blockchains, on Koinos holding $KOIN gives you the right to utilize a portion of the network without sacrificing your cryptocurrency to transaction fees. Rather than paying a transaction fee, your $KOIN is temporarily locked and gradually unlocked over time. This mechanism is referred to as mana because it mimics the user experience of a video game. You can learn more about mana on the official documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Koinos protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation and it aims to improve decentralization by introducing a Proof-of-Burn (PoB) consensus algorithm. Learn more about Proof-of-Burn on the official documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of its innovative resource management, Koinos enjoys interest from Web3 enthusiasts seeking the next generation of blockchain user experience (UX). A significant focus for the Koinos network is to bring a Web 2.0 experience to Web3.\nWhat makes Koinos unique?\r\nThe Koinos blockchain has several features that differentiate it from other smart contract platforms. These include forkless upgrades, the mana system, smart wallet support and the Proof-of-Burn consensus algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the core business logic of Koinos is implemented via smart contracts, core functionality can be upgraded without the use of hard forks. While hard forks may be necessary to fix critical bugs or improve performance, many enhancements can be achieved simply through replacing smart contracts and a vote in governance. This allows Koinos to evolve at a more rapid rate than other blockchains. You can learn more about forkless upgrades and the governance system on the official documentation overview.\r\n\r\n\r\nKoinos handles resources differently than other blockchains. Holding $KOIN grants access to a portion of the network. While most other blockchains have transaction fees, Koinos allows the user to pay in time. The more $KOIN the user holds, the more network the user has access to and the faster their mana pool regenerates. Learn more about mana on the official documentation overview.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Koinos there is no difference between an account and a smart contract. Every account can also have a smart contract associated with it. Because an account is no different than a smart contract, account abstraction is baked into the protocol. It is no longer necessary to work solely with a private/public key pairing. Instead, Koinos features a turing complete authority system which allows for unlimited possibilities of smart contract upgrades, transaction payment handling, and contract calls. Learn more about authorities on the official documentation for developers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Proof-of-Burn (PoB) consensus is not well known but offers a variety of advantages of the traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithms. Miners are virtualized on-chain leveling the playing field no matter the electricity costs of your local jurisdiction. This promotes decentralization as mining operations do not need to consolidate around locales with economic electricity costs. In addition, Proof-of-Burn solves the issue of consolidating stake on Centralized Exchanges (CEX) because the cryptocurrency must be burned in order to produce blocks or affect governance. Learn more about the novel Proof-of-Burn implementation on the official documentation overview.\nHow many $KOIN are in circulation?\r\nKoinos was completely fair-launched, just like Bitcoin. It was originally Proof-of-Work mined into existence on the Ethereum blockchain in order to bootstrap the initial supply. Over the course of a year, approximately 100 million $KOIN were mined and used to establish the initial balances of the blockchain upon launch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the mainnet launch on November 5th, 2022 the chain was in-band upgraded from federated to Proof-of-Burn and $KOIN was burnt in exchange for virtual hashpower to secure the network. Because $KOIN is constantly being burned in order to secure the network, the supply is dynamic so you should check popular block explorers like Koiner for precise numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe supply can be most simply described as 100 million with 2% inflation annually and target burn of 50%. This is an oversimplification but you can learn more about the tokenomics on the official documentation overview.\nHow is the Koinos network secured?\r\nThe Koinos network is secured through the innovative Proof-of-Burn (PoB) consensus algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlock producers burn their $KOIN and receive Virtual Hash Power (VHP) in return. This can be thought of exactly like hash power on Proof-of-Work (PoW) chains. The more hash power you have, the more likely you are to produce a valid block. It\u2019s as simple as that. The details of the implementation can be found by reading the Proof-of-Burn on the official documentation architecture section.\n",

These tokens are earned by watching the feed in the Cheelee app. All internal calculations on the platform are carried out in LEE. Its issue is strictly limited; the total supply is 7,000,000,000. \r\n\r\nThe rate of LEE's accrual algorithmically depends on the number of tokens mined: the more they are mined, the more difficult it is to get new LEE tokens. The complexity of LEE's mining is constantly growing: by 7% per month and 84% per year. This stimulates the token prices to rise, which, in turn, encourages users to use the hodl strategy more often.\r\n\r\nSince LEE is the utility token and is utilized for all app accruals, its demand is fueled by the growth of the Cheelee platform. Here are the ways Cheelee participants can use LEE:\r\n\r\nUpgrade NFT glasses\r\nCharge NFT glasses\r\nMint NFT glasses\r\nPromote content on the platform\r\nMake donations\r\n\r\nWhat Makes LEE Unique?\r\n- LEE token's potential audience is 4.6 billion social media users, which is more than half of all people living on our planet today. Consider also that the social networking market does not stand still and is constantly growing! The Cheelee platform's utility asset can grow in price for decades thanks to this enormous potential audience.\r\n\r\n- LEE is the GameFi world's new bitcoin. We can state this with confidence since, like the first cryptocurrency, LEE has a limited supply and an algorithmically increasing mining complexity. Combined with the factor of a huge potential audience, this makes LEE an asset that will become increasingly rare and expensive over time. Just like bitcoin!\r\n\r\n- When all the LEEs are mined, which, according to our calculations, will happen in about 5 years, they will not run out but will become an increasingly rare resource. Following that, Cheelee intends to repurchase LEEs from the market and use them to pay for viewings. ",

Aave strives to break through the traditional bank loans system with a more efficient solution. Aave also uniquely allows a borrower and a lender to decide on important loan details that can eliminate the need of a middle man. Due to the elimination of middlemen, process fee for a loan does not exist on this platform. This provide convenience to any lender and borrower to create loans on their agreed terms. Decentralized lending has fixed many issues and one of the reasons why is the transparency of loan.\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum network provides a transparent ledger where all transactions are available to be inspected. Secondly, it isn\u2019t necessary to find a trusted loan provider because all collateral which is the digital asset for loans are stored and locked in a smart contract and broadcasted on the public ethereum blockchain. It is also flexible for borrower to manage the collateral by refilling or withdrawing part of it. Borrower may make such changes when the lender is notified and aware of such movement. If the lender finds out that the action is not communicated, the lender is allowed to initiate a margin call.  \r\n\r\nThis year, Aave has made a major upgrades in its Q1 2018. They have deployed the new development for their peer-to-peer lending application named Alpha 0.3. The development process of Alpha 0.3 has started since the early of 2017. The new release also includes a completely new user interface which targets to lower the learning curve of user experience on the app. Furthermore, the new user interface has new sections to make lending process simpler such as including a \u2018My Loan\u2019 section, collectible badges and more. Other than that, the team is also in the process of developing more updates for the smart contracts. Hence, the team has decided to provide zero-fee lending with the use of LEND token as a medium of exchange, as an alternative to borrowing in Ethereum. The purpose of this is to provide a cross-blockchain lending currency which will prompt users to use LEND as the medium of exchange. \r\n",

Inspired by LOL and DOTA, bringing the best 5v5 PVP Metaverse gaming experience to Android and iOS users\r\n\r\nLOA tokens can be obtained by: * Playing League Of Ancients * Staking into Ancient Realms\r\n\r\nWhat is the League of Ancients Gameplay?\r\n10 players will be thrusted into the Ancient Realm tile set map where they will engage in a 5v5 PVP team battle. The map is divided into two sides, the Luminous and the Dark Souls. The objective of the game is to destroy the base of the opposing team. Though it sounds simple, there are several layers of complexity to this. The map is vast and is focused around controlling lanes. Each lane leads to the opposing team's base and is guarded by endless waves of enemy minions and powerful turrets. Surrounding these lanes is the jungle and river which players can utilize strategically to hunt powerful creatures, escape, ambush and or navigate the map covertly. This PVP game style has been tried and tested for over 20 years, proving to be endlessly entertaining and exciting\r\n\r\nThere are 3 Game Modes:\r\n\r\nNormal Match Normal Match is the first and earliest game mode in League of Ancients. All other game modes use the mechanics of Normal Matches as their base. It is an UNRANKED 5v5 PVP experience. This means that players do not lose rank titles if they did not win the game. This mode is suitable for beginners who need to familiarize themselves with the gameplay mechanics. You are free to choose any hero to play with. However, you are not allowed to have more than one of the same hero on your team. The opposing team however, CAN pick the same hero that is chosen on your team. Players can earn in-game currency by completing each normal match.\r\n\r\nNFT Match NFT Match is a competitive seasonal game mode that runs for a specific period of time. You will be competing with other players sharing your ranked division bracket. Players will have access to play all the heroes as long as they have a certain number of NFT skins at any rarity level. The rank titles from lowest to highest are Sentinel, Royal Knight, Zealot, Duke, Arch-Duke, Lord, Overlord. Sentinel is the lowest division, whereas Overlord is for the best of the best. Every time you win a Ranked match, you will gain MMR and in-game currency. The amount of in-game currency will be higher compared to playing a normal match. When the season ends, the rankings will be reset accordingly and a new season begins.\r\n\r\nTournaments Tournaments is a feature of the game that allows organizers to host in-game tournaments. It will be supervised by League of Ancients. Each participating team has to pay a registration fee, where 5% of the total registration fee collected will be for the tournament organizer to cover for the administration purpose. The teams will challenge each other for the total prize pool allocated for that specific tournament. Prize pool consists of $LOA tokens\r\n\r\nHow Many LOA tokens Are There in Circulation?\r\nLOA token is scheduled for a TGE on December 12,2021 with 1 billion LOA tokens created at genesis with the following allocations: *Play-to-Earn: 25% *Staking: 15% *NFT Staking: 8% *Liquidity: 1% *Centralized Exchange: 5% *Ecosystem Fund: 3% *Marketing: 5% *Advisors: 4% *Community: 2% *Team Tokens: 20% *Private Sales: 10% *Pre-Sales and Initial Dex Offering: 2%\r\n\r\nWho Are the Core Team behind the League of Ancients?\r\nDwayne Ong - Governor (Project Lead) A crypto enthusiast and entrepreneur with experience in multiple startups of various industries.

        "description": "\"Disrupting the Travel Industry\r\n\r\nLockTrip.com is a blockchain-based travel marketplace that allows users to save up to 60% on their bookings by cutting out middlemen and their commissions. Choose among various payment methods such as credit card, popular cryptocurrencies and the native LOC token to bypass payment fees.\r\n\r\nMore than 2.1 Million Hotels & Properties\r\n\r\nLockTrip is working with the strongest brands in the travel industry to offer its customers first class inventory around the globe. Thanks to our vast network of partners, we are not only fulfilling the needs of our customers, but also let the strongest brands compete with each other. Thanks to our unique reverse-auctioning model, customers will always be presented the lowest price possible.\r\n\r\nMore than 1,000 Airlines to Choose From\r\n\r\nWith more than 1,000 Airlines to choose from globally, LockTrip is better connected than any other marketplace in the industry. Both Hotels & Flights are bookable from the same marketplace in a one-stop shop solution.\r\n\r\nAbout the LOC Token\r\n\r\nLockTrip's unique business model funnels the entire economy through the LOC token. Each booking made on the marketplace results in 3% of the booking value being used to buy LOC from exchanges and burn them. The process is fully automated and can be verified transparently on the blockchain.\r\n\r\nDeflationary Model\r\n\r\nContrary to most other tokens and coins, the LOC supply is not growing or remaining constant. Indeed it is shrinking with each booking and it's subsequent burn. This mechanism will continue indefinitely as there is no limit in time or number of LOC to be burnt.\r\n\r\nLockTrip is powered by the Hydra chain, which emerged through the combination of the best features of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Qtum chains. It thus presents cutting-edge technology with unique economic features.\"",

        "description": "\"What Is LOCUS CHAIN (LOCUS)?\r\nLocus Chain aims to be the most widely used Next Generation Layer 1 Public Blockchain Protocol, which achieves both full decentralization and scalability simultaneously. As a decentralized scalable layer 1 chain based on patented technologies, Locus Chain aims to support various Defi, GameFi, Metaverse, Smart City, CBDC(Central Bank Digital Currency) projects by being the most reliable, secure, low cost and high performance layer 1 public blockchain platform. Locus Chain claims to be the first decentralized Layer 1 public blockchain to ever solve the blockchain trilemma of Decentralization. Scalability and Security.\r\n\r\nLOCUS token?\r\nThe current Locus token type before the mainnet is an Ethereum-based ERC20 token with smart contract issued by Locus Chain Foundation. However, given that the tokens on the public Ethereum network cannot be used on the Locus Chain directly, we will be making use of hashed time-locked contracts to allow 1-to-1 atomic swaps of Locus tokens from Ethereum to the Locus Chain mainnet. LOCUS will be the main cryptocurrency required for all the operations of the Locus Chain network and all of its applications. LOCUS is a payment method for the entire network economy. Tokens are used by validators (who can easily participate), developers, and users to participate in the LOCUS network and receive rewards. It is also used to for fees and to participate in future governance.\r\n\r\nLOCUS Ecosystem\r\nTop developers and high profile business partners are participating in the development of Locus Chain one after another. High-performance Layer 1 blockchain can create various business opportunities in sectors including decentralized finance, real estate transaction platforms, and game money, etc as well as creating various other tokens. In addition, Locus Chain allows the users to use the blockchain verification service through a simple linkage without building a separate blockchain. Since it is a high-performance public blockchain platform, technology licensing will be carried out in the future in the areas of CBDC and IOT, including smart cities, smart factories, and smart grids based on vast amounts of data.\r\n\r\nSpecial technology of LOCUS\r\n*DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) - AWTC(Account-Wise Transaction Chain)\r\n\r\nThe AWTC, Account-Wise-Transaction-Chain, is a central data structure for Locus Chain's high capacity, distributed transaction processing. AWTC is a Directed-Acyclic-Graph (DAG) based data structure composed of multiple transaction chains, each for an account. Each account has its dedicated chain. A new transaction issued by an account is primarily added to the account's chain. Block grid structures, including DAG-AWTC, do not cause conflicts because there are as many points as the number of accounts to which the transaction is added, and only the owning account can record it exclusively. Also, the account that added the transaction becomes clear, so if the account holder himself is not a malicious user, the transaction is almost confirmed as soon as it is added. The ledger structure of the Locus Chain is one of the main technical features to fundamentally solve the problem of delayed transaction processing that the existing blockchains had.\r\n\r\nPOS - BFT Consensus Algorithm\r\nGiven the time required for the data to propagate sufficiently to the network, the Locus Chain first implemented a BFT definitive consensus on the DAG by attempting to consent on a small amount of historical points of time. It also selects a new proposer committee that participates in the consensus algorithm every round by a random verifiable function (VRF) based on stochastic PoS (proof of stake: the more shares, the higher the probability of being elected as a committee). Since these methods cannot identify or predict the nodes (proposer, validator) to participate in the consensus, manipulation by malicious attacks is difficult, ensuring fairness and network stability of the consensus results.\r\n*Verifiable Pruning\r\n\r\nUnlike traditional pruning, which reduces the size of a ledger by simply deleting old data to address growing ledger sizes, Locus Chain's Verifiable Pruninng uses a Skewed Merkle Tree structure to validate the legitimacy of the data even when most of the previous data is deleted in the local environment. Verifiable pruning deletes outdated data on the ledger while still being able to provide full data verification by verifying previous data with hash values.\r\n\r\n*Dynamic Sharding\r\n\r\nLocus Chain has a ledger structure formed of each account (AWTC), making it easy to adjust the number and size of the shard, and the validator ratio by relocating the shard in the event of an imbalance between shards. With dynamic sharding, the network usage that a node has to cover is reduced to 2/N when the number of shards is N. The total network TPS for network usage on the same node will increase by that amount, plus the additional ledger state sharding, which will also divide the storage usage by the number of shards.\r\n\r\nLOCUS\u2019S creators\r\nThe key development members of the Locus Chain were developers of the Blueside Engine, Korea's first commercial game engine. The core of Locus Chain technology is to effectively process and synchronize large amounts of network traffic. The developers of Blueside Engine have acquired 18 software development related intellectual property rights, which are the product of the technology accumulated through console/online games and software development over the past 20 years, and hold 2 other software patents.\"",

        "description": "LunaDoge is a DeFi meme token inspired by Dogecoin and reflect.finance. Two functions occur during each trade: static rewards and automatic liquidity pool (\"\"LP\"\") acquisition via transaction taxes. A 5% tax is applied to every trade for static rewards and a 5% tax is applied to every trade for automatic LP acquisition.\r\n\r\nStatic rewards are used to solve problems related to impermanent loss. The reward amount is conditional upon the volume of the token being traded. This mechanism aims to alleviate some of the downward sell pressure put on the token. Furthermore, the mechanism encourages holders to hold onto their tokens to obtain rewards from every LOGE transaction. The static rewards are proportionally shared over all LOGE holders and dependent on the total tokens held.\r\n\r\nAutomatic LP acquisition is a function of the contract that is beneficial for holders as the LunaDoge contract applies a 5% tax to every transaction of which half is sold to BNB (the asset paired with LOGE in the liquidity pool) and then the equal share of BNB and LOGE is added to the LP, creating an ever-increasing floor for the liquidity pool. As the liquidity pool increases, the price stability increases as well. The purpose of the automatic LP acquisition is to prevent big price swings when top holders sell or new investors want to enter the tokens without having to worry too much about slippage. The automatic LP acquisition creates a long-term benefit for the token and solves the prior issues related to static rewards, where rewarding holders was only beneficial in the short-term.",

In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.\r\n\r\nThe Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:\r\n\r\nIt serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work.

        "description": "The Livepeer project aims to deliver a live video streaming network protocol that is fully decentralized, highly scalable, crypto token incentivized, and results in a solution which can serve as the live media layer in the decentralized development (web3) stack. In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.\r\n\r\nThe Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:\r\n\r\nIt serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work. The token, and potential slashing that occurs due to protocol violation, is necessary in order to secure the network against a number of attacks.

        "description": "Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee. It was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive Scrypt proof of work mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.\r\n\r\nWhy Litecoin?\r\nLitecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or \u2018altcoin\u2019 has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at Coinbase, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n\u2018While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,\u2019 Investopedia explained.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin\u2019s blocks would be larger, but with more \u2018orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Technical Details:\r\nThe transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. \r\n\r\nLitecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. Dogecoin) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will enter the mass market.",

The best scientists in the world have researched, invented, and refined the most elite genes in history.

The game system supports multiple platforms and multiple devices: Web games (PC, mobile phone, tablet), Android, and iOS.\r\n\r\nThe second part will be in the future when humans cross time and space to build their Virtual Metaverse Empires. Players will no longer use traditional devices such as laptops or mobile phones to participate in the game, instead, they will enter a 3D virtual world, transform into gods with endless strength and abilities to create and conquer the new worlds.",

We build with five fundamental principles as our guide.\r\n\r\nThe Mainframe network is the messaging layer for the new web. This goes beyond human-to-human messaging. There are many use-cases and applications for reliably, privately, and securely routing data packets through the Mainframe peer-to-peer network. Mainframe is resistant to censorship, surveillance, and disruption. With the exception of a catastrophic asteroid event or an aggressive alien invasion, the Mainframe network is simply unstoppable. We build with five fundamental principles as our guide.\r\n\r\nThe Mainframe platform is a developer-friendly SDK providing all these services in a secure peer-to-peer fashion. It is designed to be modular and pluggable, so developers and users can configure which projects they prefer to use for the underlying service layers. Our mission is to delight developers by providing an SDK that is well-documented, supported and backed by strong developer communities.\r\n\r\nBecause it is not always clear which projects will gain the most momentum, and because developers often have varying preferences, we feel that it is important to design our underlying service architecture to be modular and pluggable, allowing developers and users to configure which projects they prefer to use for each service layer and abstracting away as much of the differences as possible. A single medium of exchange in the form of Mainframe tokens (MFT) is also used to improve the developer and user experience. Where underlying service layers cannot be retrofitted to accept MFT, we will implement atomic swaps between native service-layer tokens and MFT.",

This helps the protocol to control the governance token inflation and distribute more governance tokens to long-term holders. However, veTokenomics still have room for improvement and many veTokenomics protocols face the following issues:\r\n\r\n- Limited user base - The requirement to buy & lock governance tokens prevents many risk-averse liquidity providers to participate.\r\n- Limited income for veToken holders - veToken holders can earn zero or limited passive income.\r\n- Expensive voting power - Voters must buy and lock governance tokens in order to gain voting rights.\r\n\r\nMagpie XYZ offers a solution that helps the veTokenomics protocols to solve the above issues. Essentially the platform incentivizes governance token holders and liquidity providers to pool their assets together so that the platform can acquire governance tokens, convert into veTokens, boost yield for liquidity providers, and in return share part of protocol revenues derived from liquidity providers\u2019 boosted profits back to governance token holders. Magpie XYZ helps veTokenomics protocols to:\r\n\r\n- Get a diverse user base - Risk-averse liquidity providers can get boosted yield without the need of holding veToken.\r\n- Increase income for veToken holders - veToken holders can share part of Magpie XYZ\u2019s revenue.\r\n- Lower the voting bar - Magpie XYZ provides a cost-effective way to acquire voting rights on veTokenomics protocols by leveraging sufficient veToken balance Magpie XYZ accumulated.\r\n\r\nMagpie XYZ starts from the integration with Wombat Exchange, and will expand to more veTokenomics protocols like PancakeSwap.

Its innovative new quantum-proof protocol, known as the Tangle, gives rise to unique new features like zero fees, infinite scalability, fast transactions, secure data transfer and many others. IOTA is initially focused on serving as the backbone of the Internet-of-Things (IoT).\r\n\r\nIOTA is a cryptocurrency that has no transaction fees and requires no miners in order to process transactions.

The main purpose of IOTA is to solve some of the major problems with Blockchain technology, the main one being that the bigger the Blockchain (such as Bitcoin), the slower, more expensive, and also more restricting it is to actually transfer funds. Another issue with the Blockchain is size, as more and more Blocks are added, the longer the Blockchain gets, and therefore the less amount of computers are able to mine it. Right now BTC is over 150GB long, and so is ETH. If this size increased tenfold, very few computers would be able to mine it at all.

Meson Network is the foundation of data transmission for decentralized storage, computation, and the emerging Web3 Dapp ecosystem.\r\n\r\nMeson is trying to create the world\u2019s largest bandwidth marketplace in the future. Here, users can exchange their unused bandwidth resources with Meson for tokens, and those who need bandwidth will come to Meson\u2019s market to borrow bandwidth anywhere in the world. To achieve this goal, we cannot simply use the direct sales model.\r\n\r\nExisting cloud vendors rely more on a sales model, a top-down model, for aggregation of resources. For example, if you want to open a new local market, you need to recruit local people, and as the market coverage expands, the number of people recruited rises linearly or even exponentially. This model worked very well for the last 10\u201320 years because the sales model led to people targeting medium to large accounts, which can provide high output per account. But now, the situation is that a lot of resources are slowly dispersing to the long-tail market where the demand is much more fragmented, leading to much lesser output per account. However, demand from the long-tail market is growing stronger than the large account market. To capture the long tail market demand, there needs to be a new alternative to the direct sales model.

Establishing a casino demands at least 12 months and several million dollars. Furthermore, it requires a comprehensive understanding of the iGaming industry, including legal aspects, standard mechanics, retention strategies, bonus systems, payment processing, and collaboration with affiliate teams\u2014expertise that typically comes with experience.\r\n\r\nSolution: Team has crafted an innovative and secure solution that bridges Web2 and Web3, a concept team calls Web2.5. This enables passive income through a cryptocurrency casino utilizing the $MTK token, featuring a transparent economy and one of the highest ROI rates in the market. Investors can effortlessly become stakeholders in the casino, purchase $MTK tokens in just a few clicks, and enjoy daily returns.\r\n\r\nThe Team's Vision: Team's mission was to develop a platform that seamlessly merges the realms of crypto and gambling entertainment, without merely launching another Web3 crypto-casino with a token and ambiguous mechanics. The primary goal was to integrate the classic Web2 gambling model with Web3 technologies, enabling everyone to co-own the casino, provide liquidity, and earn a percentage of the profits. Team's long-term plans extend well beyond a traditional gambling website and include milestones such as developing a VR poker platform and White Label solutions for both VR and classical gaming websites.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, team introduced the $MTK token\u2014the cornerstone of the MetaTokens casino ecosystem. MTK is the pioneering token that offers daily rewards to holders based on the revenue of an operational and profitable Web2 casino. The token model is a Revenue Participation Token. By purchasing the token, investors become stakeholders in the casino and receive a share of the platform's operational profit proportional to their investment.\r\n\r\nThis innovative model is widely utilized in the gambling sector and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, offering a blend of partnership and high returns.\r\n\r\nThe creation of the $MTK token was driven by our desire to address existing challenges in the gambling industry and offer players new opportunities for earning, transforming the traditional gambling landscape into a more inclusive and rewarding experience.",

The different organizations such as doctors, hospitals, laboratories, pharmacists and health insurers can request permission to access a patient\u2019s record to serve their purpose and record transactions on the distributed ledger. Medicalchain provides solutions to today\u2019s health record problems. The platform is built to securely store and share electronic health records. By digitizing health records and empowering users we can leverage countless industry synergies.\r\n\r\nMedicalchain is building a platform for secure storage and utilization of electronic health records on the blockchain. The company is also building a telemedicine platform to allow users to directly connect with healthcare professionals, share their records and get consultations, second opinions, online through a secure channel.The company was originally founded in February 2016 to provide a software solution inside hospitals. The solution is known as \u2018Discharge Summary\u2019 and it uses a workflow tool to accurately write an assessment of a patient as they are being discharged from surgery or a long hospital visit. The software is currently being used by hospitals in UK and the team decided to extend this project and go further with Medicalchain. \r\n\r\nMedicalchain wants people to have access to their health records everywhere. Today, you can travel far and wide and you will have access to your phone, contacts, photos, files, bank accounts but not your health records - probably the most important and life saving information you need. In most developed countries around the world you, as a patient, have a legal right to request your records. Medicalchain is providing you with a platform to do that. But more importantly, Medicalchain wants its users to be able to use it immediately by communicating and sharing (on a time limited basis) with other doctors. The bigger vision is to allow pharmaceutical, insurance and other healthcare organisations and stakeholders to be able to interact with health records on patients' terms. Medicalchain believes that health records should be a part of everyone\u2019s life and not just referred to when someone is ill.",

Now, on this GameFi version, all these items will now be registered on the blockchain to be transferred, sold, and bought as NFTs. What's important, is that we've refined the UI/UX in which users come in and design their original content through the entirety of this game's existence. That is why the designability and usability of the NFT designing screen will be undoubtedly high.\r\n\r\nDevelopment will first focus on transferring our already existing MMORPG world onto the Blockchain to form the basis of the in-game economy. In this phase, the mechanism and framework for the production, sale, and distribution of in-game items, currencies, and characters will be completed.",

The most well-known examples are the stablecoins pegged to the US dollar as are USDT, USDC, DAI, etc. The existence of these currencies was fundamental to the development of the decentralized finance ecosystem that flourishes today on major blockchains.

Creators of the NPXS token hope that it will one day be used on their Ethereum-based Point-of-Sale devices. This approach could give basic banking services to underdeveloped regions like Latin America and  Indonesia. One of the most notorious pain points in crypto is the ability to actually make purchases. Pundi X cryptocurrency plans to change all that by distributing hundreds to thousands of point-of-sale smart devices to retailers so they can accept payment in the form of NPXS, the network\u2019s proprietary crypto token. If it can distribute the devices for free and with lower transaction fees than current card and mobile payment solutions provide, it\u2019s a grand-slam idea.\r\n\r\nPundi X raised $35 million during its ICO from September 2017 through January 21, 2018. 35,000,000,000 NPXS (at the time known as PXS) were sold during the ICO presale and crowd sale. The team retained 15,750,000 and another 1,750,000,000 was distributed to early investors and the rest was held by Pundi X for further development and marketing. It also set aside 2 percent of sold tokens to fund bounty programs across social media and online platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Pundi X team are a talented group of technologists and entrepreneurs, which seems to be exactly what this project will need for success. In general the management team is comprised of computer engineers turned serial entrepreneur. The glaring exception to this is CEO and founder Zac Cheah, who was formerly an HTML games developer, but perhaps this is why he surrounded himself with such a strong team. The President of Pundi X, Constantin Papadimitrou, has a long history of founding successful fintech companies, and scaling them, which makes him an ideal fit for a project that will need rapid growth and adoption. The CTO/COO Pitt Huang created and sold his first business by the age of 25 and went on to create and sell several more business, including one that had over 200 employees.\r\n\r\nThe company is working on developing a card, which they are naming the XPASS card, which will work together with the mobile app and wallet, enabling payments and deposits by card (a familiar medium for most) that are pulled from the mobile wallet. In addition, users should be able to see the current market price of each cryptocurrency before paying for goods and services, allowing them to pay with the cryptocurrency that brings the best value at the time. This ability to pay for things easily with cryptocurrencies is what will finally give them real value in a widespread sense.\r\n\r\nPundi X has taken on an impressive and ambitious task in tackling what could amount to everyday adoption of cryptocurrencies by the masses, if their vision is realized. The technology seems appropriate for what they\u2019re attempting, and the delivery of the first 500 POS devices shows that there is substance behind their efforts.\"",

Through the creation of nuanced digital channels, ODEM makes it possible for users to come together to raise the quality of accessible education at a reasonable cost. Additionally, the ODEM platform allows qualified and trusted individuals from across the global education scene to create customized curriculum that can help students gain practical knowledge about the market at large and allow them to gain hands-on experience within various industrial sectors. Not only that, ODEM provides students with more choices for housing, transportation, and other necessities, thereby allowing international as well as local students to take ownership of their educations.\r\n\r\nODEM connects students with various educational hubs via a smart contract-based payment platform. As a result, academic scholars can interact directly with one another and participate in the exchange of education and learning, without the involvement of intermediaries. This service allows users to access custom-designed courses and educational programs that can help them find a curriculum that meets their particular needs. Unlike the educational model used by online service providers such as Coursera and Khan Academy, where all teacher-student interaction is maintained virtually, ODEM creates customized in-person educational programs that prepare students for real-world jobs and businesses. According to the official whitepaper, the majority of ODEM\u2019s current offerings are onsite educational experiences.\r\n\r\nRichard Maaghul is the CEO of this venture. He has been in the startup domain for over two decades and has been involved with a number of emerging/disruptive technologies in the past. In addition to co-founding ODEM.IO, Rich has been involved with Chevron Corporation as an executive. William Bayrd II is the COO of this project. According to his LinkedIn profile, Bill is the founder of three companies, including big-name establishments such as Excelorators Inc. Bill possesses a D.Pharma from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Michael Zargham is the Chief Backend Engineer for ODEM. He holds a Ph.D in Systems Engineering with a specialization in decentralized systems. Also worth mentioning is the fact that Michael possesses more than a decade\u2019s worth of experience in domains such as digital systems and disruptive technology.\r\n\r\nTo invest in this company, we will have to buy its ODEM tokens. They are ERC20 Ethereum-based tokens which can be used on the educational platform to trade for educational services. You will be able to buy the ODEM tokens during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as the pre-sale was already finished in December 2017. The sale will begin on February 17 and it will last until March 19. We will be able to use ETH to buy the tokens and you can store them in any Ethereum wallet. The tokens will be distributed as soon as the sale is finished.",

ONE holders will receive 100 percent of trading fee on BigONE\u2019s platform.\r\n\r\nONE is divided into two parts:\r\n\r\nCommunity-owned\r\n51% of all ONEs belong to community. The total amount is 10.2 billion. Once mined/released, these ONE tokens can circulate on BigONE.\r\n\r\nBIG token holders owned\r\n49% of all ONEs belong to existing BIG token holders. Total amount of this part is 9.8 billion ONEs, and will be released at the same rate as the community-owned part in proportion. These ONEs will be airdropped to all BIG token holders every day. However, these ONEs airdropped to BIG holders will be frozen till June 21st, 2022 UTC+8, and cannot be circulated on the BigONE trading platform or other platforms during this period.\r\n\r\nTrade cryptos in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section, and get your trading fee rebated in ONEs of the equivalent value.\r\nRefer new users to complete registration, pass identity verification (KYC) on BigONE, and start trading in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section. As incentive, you will receive 20% of your referred new user\u2019s trading fee rebate in the form of ONEs.\r\nBIG tokens stored on BigONE platform will automatically be airdropped ONEs.\r\nHold ONEs, Share All Platform Trading Fee\r\n\r\nEveryday at 00:00 UTC+8, BigONE will take a snapshot according to the current ONE balance on the platform. All trading fee occurred on the platform during the past 24 hours will be airdropped to all ONE holders in the form of a number of crypto assets received by the platform. Allocation formula = number of ONE held / total number of ONE released\r\n\r\nAll ONEs are locked until mined, and will be gradually mined through \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d or \u201cReferral-Mining\u201d or \u201cAirdrop to BIG token holders\u201d until 20 billion ONEs are all mined.\r\n\r\n\u3010Trade-Mining\u3011\r\n\r\nTrade-Mining can only be achieved by trading crypto assets in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the platform will calculate all trading fees occurred in the \u201cTrade-mining\u201d section during the last 24 hours (from the previous 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) and unlock equivalent worth of ONEs using the average price of ONE on the same day. On the following day\u2019s 10:00 UTC+8, the trading platform will rebate these unlocked ONEs to users / miners who traded in the \u201cTrade-mining\u201d section in the previous day.\r\n\r\n\u3010Referral-Mining\u3011\r\n\r\nReferral-mining is the incentive mechanism for the platform\u2019s existing users to invite new users to sign up BigONE. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the trading platform will calculate the total trading fee from your referred new users\u2019 tradings on the previous day (from 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) to the equivalent value of ONEs. BigONE will rebate 20% of your referred new user\u2019s trading fee to you in ONE tokens. Such incentive will be given to you on the same day at 10:00 AM UTC+8.\r\n\r\nNote: The ONEs that are referral-mined are released in addition to the regular trade-mined portion, thus BIG token holders will also receive their equivalent proportion of referral-mined ONEs airdropped.\r\n\r\n\u3010Airdrop ONEs to BIG Token Holders\u3011\r\n\r\nEvery midnight (24:00 PM UTC+8) the platform will take a snapshot of the balance of BIG tokens, and airdrop mined ONEs to BIG holders\u2019 according to the formula: [Previous day\u2019s number of unlocked ONEs in the Community-owned part] / 51 x 49]. However, these ONEs given to BIG holders will be frozen until June 21st, 2022, and cannot be circulated on trading platform during this period, but the platform rebates continue to apply.\r\n\r\n\u3010Friendly Tips\u3011\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new \u201cTrade-mining\u201d rule applies and 100% of BigONE's revenue (trading fee) is rebated to ONE holders gradually, the previous BIG buy back scheme will be terminated, because BIG holders will get airdropped ONEs and receive related rebate and incentives.\r\n\r\nONE is a platform token of BigONE and is not traded on other platforms.\r\n\r\nPlease be reminded that crypto assets could be highly volatile with high risks.

Governed entirely by its community, Ooki leverages the power of the DAO to ensure all protocol developments are in lockstep with user interests and the evolving landscape of DeFi.\r\nOOKI Token\r\nCentral to the Ooki ecosystem, the OOKI token empowers community governance, allowing holders to actively participate in the DAO. Beyond governance, the token is key to the protocol\u2019s plans for fee structures, including the potential for users to pay trading fees with OOKI at a discounted rate. This approach not only enhances the utility of the OOKI token but also aligns with Ooki's vision of creating an inclusive, user-centric DeFi platform.\r\nElevating Trading with AI and Permissionless Listings\r\nOoki is pioneering DeFi innovation by developing features that merge AI-driven analytics with Permissionless Listings, transforming trading with unparalleled insights and trading freedom.\r\n\r\nAt its core, Ooki AI is engineered to revolutionize trading strategies by offering in-depth analysis of cryptocurrency assets. It analyzes tokenomics such as market capitalization and supply details, providing insights into a token\u2019s potential. On-chain data, including token movements and transaction volumes, offers a snapshot of liquidity and market interest.\r\nFurthermore, Ooki AI applies off-chain technical analysis with indicators like Moving Averages and RSI to forecast price trends. It also assesses market sentiment through social media analysis, identifying public perception's impact on market trends.\r\nBy integrating diverse data sources, Ooki AI identifies bullish or bearish trends, simplifying market data into actionable insights. This integration of AI and Permissionless Listings empowers traders with the tools needed for confident, informed decisions in the DeFi space.\r\nDynamic Lending and Borrowing\r\nOoki\u2019s borrowing and lending capabilities are designed with user needs in mind, featuring adaptive interest rates that respond to market conditions. This ensures lenders and borrowers are always engaged with the most favorable terms, optimizing the financial dynamics of the DeFi ecosystem.\r\nProtocol Revenue through Staking\r\nStaking within the Ooki ecosystem not only secures the network but also rewards OOKI token holders with a share of the protocol\u2019s revenue. This dual benefit reinforces the value of holding and staking OOKI, aligning the interests of users with the long-term success of the protocol.\r\n\r\nMulti-Blockchain Accessibility: Ookiverse\r\nOoki\u2019s commitment to accessibility and diversity is evident in its support for multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Optimism, and Arbitrum. This broad reach ensures users have the flexibility to operate within their preferred blockchain ecosystem, with plans to expand this list following community guidance.\r\nCommunity-Driven Governance\r\nThe Ooki DAO is the embodiment of decentralized governance, with the OOKI token serving as the key to participating in protocol decisions. From initial forum discussions to Snapshot and on-chain voting, the community is the driving force behind Ooki\u2019s direction, ensuring the protocol remains responsive and innovative.\r\nThe Road Ahead\r\nOoki is on a continuous journey of growth and innovation, with the development of AI, PL, and fee discounts for OOKI payments mapping out an exciting future. These advancements, still in the pipeline, represent Ooki\u2019s dedication to enhancing its DeFi platform, making it more intelligent, user-friendly, and community-focused.\r\n",

It enables efficient execution across multiple processing units, significantly enhancing computing speed and resource utilization.\r\n\r\nDeploy Parallel Code To Harness The Full Value Of Your GPUs/CPUs & Drive Down Costs\r\n\r\nParallelAI is an advanced AI language platform to improve the use of compute resources. Made for businesses facing performance issues, ParallelAI uses cutting-edge parallel processing techniques to increase efficiency, helping organizations get more done while reducing the need for large infrastructures.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nUnleashing The Power Of Parallel Processing Solution To Slash Computation Times For AI Developers By Up To 20x\r\n\r\nThe exponential rise of generative AI technology has created unprecedented demand for GPUs, which current supply is struggling to keep up with. Multiple decentralized GPU marketplaces have emerged to fill this supply gap, allowing AI developers to tap into idle compute power distributed amongst both individuals and enterprise-scale solutions providers. However, increasing the volume of available GPUs is only half the battle in meeting the ever-growing demands of the AI industry. \r\n\r\nFor increasingly complex generative AI tools to become scaleable, not only do they need access to more GPU capacity, but they also need to use that capacity in a more cost-effective and efficient manner. Whilst much is being done to address the capacity issue, little progress is being made in ensuring this new capacity is used in ways that maximize processing speed and minimize costs. \r\n\r\nA key opportunity for reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of GPU usage lies in the way that code is executed. Traditional sequential programming does not fully utilize the computational power available from modern multi-core CPUs and GPUs. This results in underperformance, where the potential of the hardware is not fully exploited, leading to slower processing times and increased operational costs. \r\n\r\nParallel AI solves this problem by providing a novel parallel processing solution that makes it faster and more efficient for AI developers to run complex tasks on GPUs and CPUs. By enabling automatic parallelization of code, Parallel AI ensures that applications can run tasks concurrently across multiple processing cores. This maximizes hardware utilization, reduces processing time, and increases overall system efficiency. A task that would typically take 10 minutes can now be done in 10 seconds, reducing computation time by up to 20x. \r\n\r\nThe Parallel AI solution takes out all of the complexity of executing parallel processing by providing high-level programming interfaces that automate and simplify the parallelization process. Developers can write code in a style they are familiar with, which Parallel AI then converts into an optimized parallel format, abstracting away the complexities of parallel execution. \r\n\r\nFinally, Parallel AI matches AI developers to GPU providers that offer the optimal specifications for managing the parallel processing tasks that it facilitates. Aggregating compute power from existing decentralized GPU marketplaces, Parallel AI selects the best-fit hardware offerings and optimizes their outputs via its preconfigured parallelization process. By accepting payments for Parallel AI\u2019s services in the form of its native $PAI tokens, Parallel AI can seamlessly integrate payment flows into the aggregated decentralized GPU marketplaces in which its parallel code is executed. As a bulk buyer of compute power, Parallel AI can also negotiate discounts with GPU marketplace partners that accept $PAI, allowing it to emerge as a universal currency for GPU procurement. In doing so, $PAI facilitates Parallel AI\u2019s vision of delivering a fully decentralized parallel processing solution for AI developers. \r\n\r\nIn summary, Parallel AI provides an end-to-end parallel processing solution all the way from coding, through processing, to back-end infrastructure that ensures AI developers reduce their GPU costs and decrease their processing times. In doing so, Parallel AI solves the biggest problem facing AI developers today and provides the key missing piece in solving the GPU supply crunch.\r\n\r\n",

Paxos was the first virtual currency company to receive a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services. As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.\r\n\r\nThe Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It\u2019s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos describes itself as \u201cthe first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise\u201d, and it is using that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements. What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company, and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement platform using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It\u2019s been picked up and listed by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, OKEx, Gate.io, ZB, KuCoin and DigiFinex. These exchanges are offering PAX as an alternative to the controversial Tether. Unlike the controversy surrounding the people who control Tether, there is no such obscurity when it comes to the people behind Paxos. The CEO and co-founder is Charles Cascarilla. He has over 15 years in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.\r\n\r\nThe Pax Dollar (USDP) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution.

Over 200 security tokens have been deployed using their Ethereum-based solution and they are now in the midst of launching Polymesh, an institutional-grade blockchain built specifically for regulated assets. Polymath streamlines antiquated processes and opens the door to new financial instruments by solving the inherent challenges with public infrastructure around identity, compliance, confidentiality, and governance. \r\n\r\nRecognizing that the industry lacked security-specific standards, Polymath spearheaded the creation of a unified standard for security tokens on Ethereum, ERC 1400. ERC 1400 acts as an umbrella of standards and is designed to address some of the challenges in managing security tokens by enabling the ability to conserve UBO rights for custodied assets, and automate transfer control (including KYC verification) and corporate actions (including capital distribution or voting). \r\n\r\nPolymath has brought forward many advanced innovations that address regulatory and market needs head-on. They have built a series of tools on the chain that offer non-technical users an intuitive means to access the chain\u2019s functionality, and are also in the midst of launching Polymesh, an institutional-grade blockchain built for security tokens and the first specialized chain of this nature. Security tokens have the ability to alter the financial landscape, unlocking trillions of dollars in asset value and investment, programmably automating operations, and driving new paths to liquidity - but there are significant barriers standing in the way of institutional adoption. The foundations of Polymesh are focused on the most crucial regulatory elements addressed by four key design principles meant to meet the demands of regulators and institutions. Those four principles are Identity, Compliance, Confidentiality, and Governance. When put together, these four pillars can also support complex operations, such as settlement. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to creating and managing digital securities, Polymesh\u2019s specificity gives it, and the applications built on it, a distinct advantage over those leveraging general-purpose blockchains. The purpose-built infrastructure addresses the gaps in standard blockchain architecture to align the functioning of the blockchain with the requirements of modern capital markets. By combining Polymesh\u2019s deep functionality with user-friendly tools, Polymath stands to transform capital markets.\r\n\r\nAll transactions on the Polymath platform take place using the native POLY token. POLY is the utility token that fuels Polymath Token Studio on Ethereum and is used by issuers creating and managing security tokens on the platform. ",

Tapping into the intense appetite for both high fashion and toy poodles, Poodlana is a coin created specifically for the Asian market. \r\n\r\nThese strategic decisions by the Poodlana team are based on several insights. Firstly, according to recent data published in CoinDesk, 80% of meme coin trading occurs within Asian hours. And according to Statista, the Far East consumes more luxury fashion than any other region. This direct appeal to such a rich market was likely a contributor to Poodlana raising over $1 million in the first 24 hours of its presale. \r\n\r\nSecondly, poodles have shown particular popularity across east Asia, ranking within the top three breeds in China, Japan, and Korea, according to Statista. Since the meme/altcoin market has been heavily dominated by doge derivatives for the past several years, this poodle-centric decision was made to offer East Asian investors a dog-themed meme coin tailored to Asia's specific dog preference. \r\n\r\nRoadmap wise, now that Poodlana has listed on CEX it\u2019s ramping up marketing and product development. The Poodlana team has plans to expand its influencer relationships. And, in keeping with its high fashion positioning, Poodlana will be partnering with an array of fashion brands and lifestyle platforms to spread the Poodlana message 360 degrees. \r\n\r\nIn terms of technical innovation and community perks, Poodlana has plans to create a staking platform serving its elite, fashion-savvy audience, as well as offering them exclusive airdrops and bonuses as the project progresses through its milestones.\r\n\r\nLong-term, Poodlana has plans to take the brand fully global, using its core East Asian community as a springboard. Poodlana is going after international partnerships, high-profile event appearances, and multi-language support. And finally, like any half-decent high-profile fashion icon, Poodlana has plans for some poodle philanthropy, with plans to support a range of canine charities. ",

It has developed a blockchain-based platform that enables the tracking and trading of energy, flexibility services and environmental commodities. Its goal is to provide the platform for a fully modernised, market-driven grid that offers consumers a choice in their energy while driving the democratisation of power.\r\nHeadquartered in Zug, Switzerland, Powerledger operates in more than 10 countries. Powerledger operates on two blockchain layers; the POWR token is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, and the Powerledger blockchain - a native Solana based blockchain to process energy transactions on a more scalable network. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe POWR token is an ERC-20 token that acts as a licence required for businesses such as; utilities, renewable energy operators, microgrids, companies committed to 100% renewable energy and property developers to access Powerledger\u2019s platform, and will be able to be used to pay for transactions on the Powerledger blockchain in future. In 2015, 30 countries had reached grid parity, meaning that the price of solar-generated energy was equal to or less than the cost of local retail electricity. Powerledger combines renewable energy and blockchain technology to offer energy solutions that are cheaper and more sustainable than traditional energy alternatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPowerledger was founded in 2016 to solve a pressing problem: Energy that comes from solar and wind is intermittent and lacks the steady quality that fossil fuels provide, and this causes problems for the grid.\r\nPowerledger\u2019s approach was to create a highly agile market that could help regulate this intermittency and start to create a transition to a more responsive, distributed network with better storage. Powerledger\u2019s software is used by utilities and large corporations to track, trace, and trade every kilowatt of energy to improve grid stability. ",

It makes use of blockchain's distributed ledger technology to provide a global trading platform for invoice financing. According to the Populous website, \"invoice finance is a form of funding that instantly unlocks the cash tied up in outstanding sales invoices. Business owners allow invoice buyers to buy invoices at a discounted rate in order to unlock their cash quicker. Once invoices are paid by the invoice debtor, the invoice buyer receives the amount previously agreed upon.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to offer funds to invoice sellers, Populous maintains a Liquidity Pool. This is tied in with the Populous cryptocurrency (PPT). An investor securitizes PPT by making an initial purchase. PPT is then held in escrow as collateral throughout the process. Transactions between invoice buyers and sellers take place with Pokens, exchanged for PPT and used as the currency for buying and selling invoices, either drawing from or contributing to the Liquidity Pool in the process. As a result of this built-in liquidity component, Populous at this point requires no transaction fees. In fact, the only fees levied are those associated with late payments. Populous invoice transactions can cover a huge array of industries, including many which are not typically available to traditional financing companies.\r\n\r\nThe PPT tokens not released during the ICO were retained by the founding and development team. PPT can either be held or used as collateral to invest in Populous invoices. In exchange for collateralizing, you\u2019re given an amount of Pokens based on a percentage of market value. Currently it\u2019s the lesser of 50%, or a 30 day market average. These are automatically used to purchase an invoice. If the invoice is repaid, you receive both your PPT investment and Pokens profit.",

Liquid is a global cryptocurrency firm looking to solve the liquidity problems that have surfaced with crypto investments. Liquid brings liquidity to the cryptocurrency space by providing a means for you to easily buy cryptocurrency with and cash-out to fiat. Currently, each crypto exchange has its own level of liquidity that differs between the trading pairs it offers. This creates individual silos that may have great liquidity on one exchange but not on another. The Liquid platform connects these silos into one combined pool to give you the greatest liquidity possible.\r\n\r\nThe Liquid World Book compiles the orders and prices from exchanges around the world into one order book for you to use. This gives any trader, no matter their location, the ability to use the fiat currency of their choice when purchasing or selling crypto. It removes the liquidity silos of separate exchanges and gives more trading power to previously underserved markets. The Prime Brokerage half of the Quoine Liquid platform basically gives you access to the features outlined in the previous World Book section. With Prime Brokerage, you have direct market access to all exchanges in the World Book without having to create an account on each individual exchange. Furthermore, Quoine has been building partnerships with a network of banks over the last several years to ensure the quick transfer of your fiat funds.\r\n\r\nQASH is an ERC20 token you use to pay for services on the Liquid platform. Beyond that, QASH holders may also receive discounts, promotional products, and ICO investment opportunities with coins that Quoine helps to launch. The team also emphasizes in their whitepaper that other organizations may use it for their own purposes similar to how some financial institutions use the Ripple XRP token. Because Quoine enters a few different financial sectors, the company has quite a few competitors. As a credit facility, the company competes with SALT. On the exchange side, there are numerous other businesses like Binance specializing in alternative coins or Gemini and Coinbase focusing on fiat to crypto conversions. \r\n\r\n Mike Kayamori (CEO) and Mario Gomez Lozada (President and CTO) founded Quoine in 2014. Kayamori was previously a Senior Vice President at SoftBank Group and was the Chief Investment Officer of Gungho Asia. Lozada was the CTO of Merrill Lynch in Japan for 11 years before taking the Chief Information Officer role at Credit Suisse Japan. Quoine is the first cryptocurrency firm in the world to be officially licensed by the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA). The Liquid platform is actually the result of combining two previous platforms, Quoinex and Qryptos. At one time, those two trading platforms were performing over $12 billion of transactions each year.",

        "description": "QuarkChain is a secure, permission-less, scalable, and decentralized blockchain. One of the goals of QuarkChain is to utilize sharding technology to deliver over 1 million transactions per second (tps). Essentially, QuarkChain markets itself as a peer-to-peer blockchain with a high capacity throughput to help deliver fast and secure decentralized applications. The team behind QuarkChain created this blockchain to resolve the issue of scalability that all the major blockchains are currently facing. The team feels that because of the urgency of this issue, the Bitcoin community simply cannot afford to wait until they all agree on a solution. Instead, they feel that by offering different solutions, such as the one inherent in QuarkChain, this compels the community to split via a hard fork and find the solution that works best.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain encourages increased decentralization through multiple cheap nodes that then create a cluster that works as a super-full node. This prevents the high expenses associated with super-full nodes when the tps gets high. In terms of protection, all transactions within QuarkChain get the protection of 50 percent of the network\u2019s hash power. This makes a double-spending attack incredibly challenging, particularly when combined with QuarkChain\u2019s decentralized nature.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain relies on a two-layer blockchain structure. Sharding blockchains known as shards are the first layer, while the second layer is a root blockchain that confirms the shards\u2019 blocks.The major work on QuarkChain began in Q2 2017 with research into the problem of blockchain scalability. In Q4 of that year, the team drafted the whitepaper. In February 2018, it released the white paper and completed verification code 0.1. March 2018 saw the 0.1 versions of both the wallet and testnet. Now in Q2, the team is working on the testnet 1.0 and smart contract 0.1. In Q4 2018, the team will have the QuarkChain Core 1.0, along with the mainnet 1.0 and the SmartWallet 1.0. By Q2 2019, both the SmartWallet and QuarkChain Core will be in their 2.0 versions.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve the issues of scalability that plague existing networks by using sharding technology. In this way, QuarkChain can dramatically extend the usefulness of blockchain technology since many applications are limited by the scalability of existing blockchain networks. The project is still in progress, but QuarkChain has already made many positive steps and already began invite-based beta testing for the testnet, showing significant progress and potential.\r\n\r\nThe main features of Quarkchain are:\r\n\r\n1. Reshardable two-layered blockchain: Quarkchain consists of two layers of blockchains. We apply elastic sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, and a root blockchain as the second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer is flexible to be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.\r\n\r\n2. Guaranteed security by market-driven collaborative mining: To ensure the security of all transactions, a game-theoretic framework is designed for incentives, where at least 50% of overall hash powers are allocated to the root chain to prevent double spending attack on any transactions.\r\n\r\n3. Anti-centralized horizontal scalability: In any blockchain network with a high TPS, a super-full node can be extremely expensive, which encourages centralization. In contrast, QuarkChain allows multiple cheap nodes forming a cluster to replace a super-full node.\r\n\r\n4. Efficient cross-shard transactions: Cross-shard transactions in QuarkChain can be issued at any time, and confirmed in minutes. The speed of cross-shard transactions increases linearly as the number of shards increases.\r\n\r\n5. Simple account management: There is only one account needed for the entire blockchain (shards) in QuarkChain. All cryptocurrencies from different shards are stored in one smart wallet.",

The RADA Foundation propels the RADA cryptocurrency into operation as a governance token and employs RADA NFTs for utility objectives. In addition, the foundation intends to launch a Web3 platform dedicated to the RADA DAO community, where DAO members exercise authority by proposing, voting, and making pivotal decisions about the various RADA projects. The vision behind RADA is to pioneer a transformative approach in the world of sports and entertainment. The RADA Foundation has earmarked its first project, which centers on the 'Acquisition and management of a professional European FC in the lower leagues,' complemented by a football talent development initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\n\r\nThe RADA Foundation's primary mission is to reshape the conventional landscape of the football industry, transforming it into a democratic, fan-inclusive ecosystem that transcends borders and breaks down barriers. RADA seeks to create a platform where fans are not merely spectators but vital contributors with a sense of true ownership and belonging. This is not just about changing the club operations\u2014it is about a radical transformation of what it means to be part of a football community, a vision set to create ripples throughout the sport. Moreover, the RADA talent development program offers budding footballers an unparalleled opportunity, aiming to identify and foster talented sports individuals in collaboration with professional sports academies. The program\u2019s holistic approach ensures transparency, comprehensive care, facilities, and a robust training regimen for the player, coupled with secured funding.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\n\r\nNot all football club management possesses the requisite capabilities to elevate their club's visibility to become one of the prominent FCs in the industry. Recognizing the inherent fusion of sports and technology, RADA is committed to seamlessly integrating real-world business practices with the principles of Web3.0. Moreover, we possess the expertise to identify suitable sponsors and investors for sports ventures. In today's digital landscape, the internet facilitates universal access to project information at any time and from any location. However, with the advent of Web3.0, individuals not only gain access to project details but also have the opportunity to become key stakeholders in the project itself. In this regard, RADA endeavors to facilitate the growth of European FCs by enabling blockchain and Web3.0 enthusiasts to actively contribute to the development of these football clubs. Piloting this ambitious project is a team of experts with rich, diverse experience in sports, technology, and finance. This group of professionals shares a common goal\u2014to fuse their love for football with the transformative power of Web 3.0. Adding to this already strong team is brand ambassador, David Villa, a renowned figure in the football world. As a celebrated World Cup champion, Villa's association with RADA lends the initiative both credibility and an insider's view of the football industry. His valuable insights and global reputation will undoubtedly play a significant role in driving RADA's aim to usher the football industry into the era of Web 3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s next for your project?\r\n\r\nFor the predetermined project, the RADA team is developing a web3.0 platform based on the DAO community. The RADA Auto-executable SmartContract (RAS) Factory will be developed to complete its unique two-track hybrid voting system. Moreover, the foundation aims to integrate the Explore RADA Asset (ERA) system with Etherscan for transparent fund tracking. Furthermore, a random NFT draw system will be developed based on Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to be applied to the DAO community.\r\n\r\nIn pursuit of the first project's execution, they are conducting due diligence on European candidate Football Clubs, including Ambassadors and industry experts, with the goal of acquisition in 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\n\r\nRADA is a native token in its ecosystem. The RADA Token offers unique financial incentives, steering clear of the traditional PoW and PoS models. Instead, it rewards participants for consuming RADA tokens or active participation in the ecosystem, thereby catalyzing community engagement. By integrating a Metamask wallet with the DAO platform and holding RADA tokens, one can become a member and use tokens to propose and vote. Also, tokens can be used to participate in RADA NFT draws, and some acquired NFTs can be used as voting weights.\r\n",

Enterprise clients who want to rent compute power will do so with RAVEN and contributors of the compute power will be rewarded in RAVEN.\r\n\r\nRaven is creating a network of compute nodes that utilize idle compute power for the purposes of AI training where speed is the key. A native token is the key to bootstrapping a nascent network.\r\n\r\nWe want to incentivize and reward people all over the world to contribute their compute power to our network. Additionally, we will reward token holders for running masternodes which will be responsible for orchestrating the training of various deep neural networks.\r\n\r\nOur consensus mechanism is something we call Proof-of-Calculation. Proof-of-Calculation will be the primary guideline for the regulation and distribution of incentives to the compute nodes in the network. Following are the two prime deciders for the incentive distribution:\r\n\r\nSpeed: Depending upon how fast a node can perform gradient calculations (in a neural network) and return it back to the Gradient Collector.\r\n\r\nRedundancy: The 3 fastest redundant calculation will only qualify for receiving the incentive. This will make sure that the gradients that are getting returned are genuine and of the highest quality.",

It\u2019s complementary to the Ethereum blockchain and works with any ERC20 compatible token. The Raiden project is work in progress. Its goal is to research state channel technology, define protocols and develop reference implementations. The introduction of payment channels, specifically the type first described by the Lightning Whitepaper (which introduced the Lightning Network), seeks to fix the scalability and congestion issues that currently plague blockchain technology. While the Lightning Network operates on the Bitcoin blockchain, Raiden introduces a comparable solution for the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nThere are several key features of the Raiden Network Token. Expedited transfer confirmations (<1 second ). Current transfers on the Ethereum blockchain can take a few seconds to minutes. Private transfers that are not viewable on the global ledger. Solve scalability issues so that Ethereum can create mass adoption, allowing Ethereum to become the peer-to-peer, global payments infrastructure with electronic cash that it was initially designed for. Low fee transactions. Micropayment capability that works in union with any ERC-20 token.\r\n\r\nThe Raiden Network project is being developed by Germany\u2019s Brainbot Technologies AG, a software company devoted to blockchain protocol development. Founded in the year 2000 by Heiko Hees, it currently has between 11 to 50 employees in offices among Berlin, Mainz, and Copenhagen. Also the founder of PediaPress, Hees has been a core developer of Ethereum since March 2014. Being a core developer for Ethereum, it is evident on how the founder sees the flaws in the current its present protocol with ways to improve it. Interestingly enough, the website does not include RDN as one of their main blockchain developments, which could be attributed to the difficulty of highlighting a wide variety of projects they are currently undertaking on one page. However, there are no updates on the status of the Raiden Network Project on either Twitter nor Medium since December 1st, 2017.\r\n\r\nRaiden can be used for a wide variety of applications and purposes such as Micropayments For Content Distribution, Decentralized M2M Markets, API Access and Fast Decentralized Exchanges.\"",

However, with RenQ wallet, new users will be able to enjoy all of the benefits of centralized exchanges while using a decentralized solution.\r\nRenQ enables the creation of entirely new asset classes whose value is derived from blockchainbased assets. Financial products such as derivatives and margin trades enable investors to achieve superior portfolio risk management and open up new speculation avenues. In addition, they increase market efficiency for the underlying asset by facilitating price discovery and permitting individuals to express more nuanced opinions on price and volatility. RenQ offers advantages over conventional financial products by eliminating the need for a regulated central clearing house, providing global and equal access, and granting users permanent control over their funds. The derivatives market on existing financial infrastructure is vastly larger than any other market for financial assets. It is estimated to be greater than $1.2 quadrillion, or more than 10 times the global GDP.

RLC is short for \u201cRun on Lots of Computers.\u201d\r\n\r\niExec is headquartered at Lyon, France. It was founded by Gilles Fedak and Haiwu He, both are serving as Chief Executive Officer and Head of Asian-Pacific Region of iExec, respectively. Oleg Lodygensky is the Chief Technical Officer. Gilles Fedak received his PhD from the University of Paris Sud in 2003, and has been working as INRIA (Inventeurs du Monde Numerique) research scientist at ENS in Lyon, France. Similarly, Haiwu completed his M.Sc. and PhD from the University of Sciences and Technologies of Lille, France. On April 19, 2017, iExec launched its token sale and raised more than $12 million in exchange for 86,999,784 RLC.\r\n\r\nIn order to support dApps, smart contracts, and their platforms, iExec takes processing-intensive computations off-chain so as to keep a blockchain\u2019s on-chain functions running smoothly. To do this, iExec makes use of XtremWeb-HEP, an open-sourced Desktop Grid Software.  Desktop Grid computing (also known as Volunteer Computing) pools unused computing resources to be used by applications and platforms, and according to iExec\u2019s whitepaper, XtremWeb-HEP \u201cimplements all the needed features\u201d to make this possible on a global scale, including \u201cfault-tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, hybrid public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images, data management, security and accountability, and many more.\u201d Essentially, with this software, dApps can utilize any computing resource in the iExec framework to run their programs.\r\n\r\nIn their whitepaper, the iExec team lays out the project\u2019s competitive landscape and explains these competitors in relation to iExec. They\u2019re quick to note that decentralized cloud storage providers like Filecoin, Storj, and Siacoin are not direct competitors, and it\u2019s easy to see why.  While iExec could theoretically take a step in this direction as it matures, it\u2019s not a storage platform; it\u2019s a computing platform. This does put it in competition with other decentralized computing protocols like Golem and SONM. Both of these, however, are taking aim at a different animal.  Essentially, they\u2019re both building a decentralized supercomputer on blockchain technology, while iExec is targeting dApp development and sustainability.  Both look towards a future of a blockchain-powered, decentralized internet, but their functions, while sometimes similar, are more complementary than conflicting.",

It is an Ethereum ERC20 token that is pegged to $1 USD\u200a\u2014\u200aevery Dai is worth $1, and will always be worth $1, regardless of how much Dai is in existence. There is no centralized authority like Tether that backs its value, and no traditional bank that backs each Dai with a real US dollar. There is nothing that can be shut down, and no centralized authority that needs to be trusted. Dai lives entirely within the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.\r\n\r\n*Features of Dai:\r\n1. Dai is always worth $1 USD each\r\n2. It can be freely traded like any other ERC20 token\r\n3. Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it\r\n4. It can be exchanged without any middleman\r\n5. No individual person or company has control over it\r\n6. No government or authority can shut it down\r\n\r\n*How Dai Works?\r\nDai is a masterpiece of game theory that carefully balances economic incentives in the pursuit of one goal\u200a\u2014\u200aa token that is continuously approaching the value of $1 USD.\r\n\r\nWhen Dai is worth above $1, mechanisms work to decrease the price. When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1\u200a\u2014\u200ait is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.\r\n\r\n*How is Dai Created?\r\nDai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.\r\n\r\nFirst, ETH is turned into \u201cwrapped ETH\u201d (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This \u201ctokenizes\u201d ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token. Next, WETH is turned into \u201cpooled ETH\u201d (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created. Once you have PETH, you can create a \u201ccollateralized debt position\u201d (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH. As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP. Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.\r\n\r\n*There are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:\r\n\r\n1. You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loan\r\n\r\n2. You believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin\u200a\u2014\u200ayou lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so\u200a\u2014\u200amargin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n3. The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD. This is essentially free money, and is one of the mechanisms the Maker system uses to keep Dai pegged to $1 USD. Dai being worth over $1 USD encourages more Dai to be created.\r\nThese three reasons are enough to ensure that Dai is continually created.",

Sator also pushes NFT innovation ahead by embedding show-specific NFTs with extremely unique utilities, new profile-display features and experiential relevance; at this time in history when NFTs are maturing as a category and demand is growing for ways to utilize, display and discover NFT potentiality.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDemand to \u201cearn crypto for watching tv\u201d is evident from consumers\u2019 perspective. Thus, Sator\u2019s economy empowers consumers to directly participate in value they create by engaging as a viewer. At the same time, Sator\u2019s value-proposition is compelling\u00a0\r\nfrom a content provider\u2019s perspective. Indeed, content providers gain turnkey, self-replenishing viewership growth campaigns, plus comprehensive NFT solutions spanning creation to monetization.\r\n\r\nThe Sator decentralized application contains a thoughtfully constructed set of staking mechanisms whereby users staking certain levels of $SAO boost their earnings by unlocking rewards multipliers on all their activities. Easy re-staking and multiplier rates increasing at higher staked levels all serve to deeply incentivize loyalty, activity on the platform and long-term $SAO holding.\r\n",

This project is not just another blockchain-based initiative; it is a registered legal church with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which lends it a level of legitimacy and purpose that is often lacking in the crypto space. By leveraging the power and transparency of blockchain technology, The Smoking Chicken Fish aims to facilitate donations and provide robust community support for a variety of religious activities.\r\n\r\nA New Paradigm in Religious Support\r\nThe Smoking Chicken Fish project represents a new paradigm in how religious organizations can interact with their communities and supporters. Traditional methods of collecting donations often involve physical collections during services or manual transactions that can be cumbersome and lack transparency. By using blockchain technology, this project ensures that donations are not only easier to make but also more secure and transparent. Every transaction can be tracked and verified, giving donors confidence that their contributions are being used as intended.\r\n\r\nEmpowering Communities Through Blockchain\r\nBlockchain technology is at the heart of The Smoking Chicken Fish, providing a decentralized and secure platform for all transactions. This technology ensures that all donations are immutable and tamper-proof, which is crucial for maintaining trust within the community. The use of smart contracts can automate and streamline various administrative tasks, reducing the burden on church staff and allowing them to focus more on their core mission. Additionally, blockchain can help in managing church assets and expenses with greater efficiency and accuracy.\r\n\r\nBridging Spirituality and Technology\r\nThe Smoking Chicken Fish uniquely bridges the gap between spirituality and technology. In an era where digital currencies and blockchain are becoming increasingly prevalent, this project offers a way for religious organizations to stay relevant and engage with a younger, tech-savvy demographic. The project's innovative approach can attract individuals who might not be reached through traditional religious practices, thereby expanding the church\u2019s influence and membership.\r\n\r\nEnhancing Transparency and Accountability\r\nOne of the significant advantages of using blockchain technology in the context of donations is the enhanced transparency and accountability it offers. Donors can see exactly how their contributions are being used, which can increase trust and encourage more people to donate. This level of transparency is often missing in traditional donation systems, where it can be challenging to track how funds are allocated and spent.\r\n\r\nCommunity Support and Engagement\r\nBeyond facilitating donations, The Smoking Chicken Fish is also focused on providing strong community support. The project aims to create a vibrant and engaged community where members can support each other spiritually and financially. By using blockchain, the project can offer various community engagement tools, such as voting on important church matters, participating in community events, and even receiving rewards for active participation.\r\n\r\nEducational Initiatives\r\nThe Smoking Chicken Fish project is not just about technology and donations; it also has a strong educational component. The project aims to educate its community about the benefits and uses of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. This education can help demystify these technologies and make them more accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, educating the community about responsible financial practices and the risks associated with gambling in the crypto market is a key focus.\r\n\r\nFuture Prospects and Growth\r\nLooking ahead, The Smoking Chicken Fish has ambitious plans for growth and expansion. The project aims to partner with other non-profit organizations and religious institutions to broaden its impact. By collaborating with like-minded entities, The Smoking Chicken Fish can enhance its offerings and provide even more value to its community. The project also plans to continually innovate by exploring new blockchain technologies and applications that can further support its mission.",

Fossil fuels proved a boon to mankind as they were widely available and could be harnessed easily.\r\n\r\nWhen these fossil fuels were started using extensively by all the countries across the globe, they led to the degradation of the environment. Coal and oil are two of the major sources that produce a large amount of carbon dioxide in the air. This led to an increase in global warming.\r\n\r\nAlso, few countries have held on these valuable products, which led to the rise in the prices of these fuels. Now, with rising prices, increasing air pollution and the risk of getting expired soon forced scientists to look out for some alternative or renewable energy sources.\r\n\r\nWe turned a tweet into a real use case!

Technology is too advanced on Neptune but humans could not reach this far to see all the innovations that it has to bring, therefore Shibelon studied astronomy and saw that there was a very high population on earth with very limited resources to reach advanced technology. On September 28th 1971, Shibelon sent his first electromagnetic signal into South Africa which changed the world as we know it. This signal influenced an unborn child who will carry a prodigy that will revolutionise the monetary system. On June 28th 1971, that child was born, but he wasn\u2019t a normal child, he was born a genius. And his lovely mother named him Elon Musk.\r\n\r\nShibelon then took his time to develop intergalactic travel and on August 18th 2008, he transferred a source code to planet earth and deployed a monetary online currency which is referred to as Bitcoin to see what the humans could do with it. He was thrilled when he found out that people started transacting with it as he intended and on May 22nd 2010 he saw a thread from a student in California who wanted to buy a pizza for 10,000 Bitcoins and decided to approve that transactions to help facilitate the adoption. Which it did! He watched over Earth for years now and has almost completed his Super Rocket which is set to take course to earth on November 10th 2021 to help create the greatest wealth transfer in\r\n\r\n the history of the universe. As time draws near and travel gets boring alone, he will be entertaining himself on the journey by creating and developing a roadmap to his own token on the Binance Smart Chain assisted by his best friend, Adam King, who will bring only the latest never seen before technological advances to the Blockchain.\r\n\r\nAside from the solidity contract he has created to be shared with Humans, his Roadmap involves Advanced Staking, Super Swaps, 3D NFTs, Play 2 Earn Gaming and many more that he will be sharing on his way to Earth.\r\nExpect him.

        "description": "SIREN is a distributed protocol for creating, trading, and redeeming fully-collateralized options contracts for any ERC-20 token on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nAbout SIREN\r\nOptions are a financial primitive from which one can build many different more complex financial instruments. At their core, options give a trader the choice to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a known time in the future. This is useful for protecting one's self (also known as hedging) against possible price changes in the asset, as well as speculating on these price changes.\r\n\r\nCore Protocol Mechanics\r\nSIREN uses a fully-collateralized approach to writing options that doesn\u2019t require any oracles to function. A single MarketsRegistry contract creates and coordinates individual markets. Once a Market contract is created anyone can interact with it in a permissionless manner. The solvency of a position is ensured at all times by the collateral locked in the smart contract.\r\n\r\nWith SIREN, both the long and short side of the contract are tokenized. The buyer\u2019s side (bToken) gives the holder the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined strike priceThe seller\u2019s/writer\u2019s side (wToken) allows the holder to withdraw the collateral (if the option was not exercised) or withdraw the exercise payment (if the option was exercised) from the contract after expiration.\r\n\r\nWhen a trader buys a put the on-chain token amount is multiplied by the strike. For example, a 1 WBTC $20K PUT will result in 20,000 bTokens. For the same reason, a put is just a reversed-assets call (e.g. a WBTC/USDC put is actually a USDC/WBTC call).\u200b\r\n\r\nTokenizing both sides of the contract allows SIREN to create secondary markets for both the long and short exposure. Under such a design in order to become a writer one purchases a wToken from the SirenSwap AMM (see below). A writer can also unwind their short exposure by selling the wToken back to the AMM. This streamlines the write-side mechanics by reducing it to essentially purchasing the underlying collateral at discount\u200a\u2014\u200aas opposed to a typical design where the writer mints long tokens and has to then sell them in order to realize the premium.\r\n\r\nSirenSwap AMM\r\nBootstrapping liquidity is core to creating a thriving market. Options are notoriously difficult when it comes to that. Not only does liquidity get fractured by combination of strike prices and expirations, it also requires sophistication on the part of liquidity providers in order to ensure fair and sustainable pricing.\r\n\r\nTo ensure liquidity on day 1 the SIREN protocol utilizes a custom SirenSwap AMM that uses a novel combination of a constant-product bonding curve and options minting to trade both bTokens and wTokens. Notably, the AMM doesn\u2019t require any asset in the pool other than bTokens/wTokens in order to trade them against the collateral asset (e.g. WBTC). This increases LP capital efficiency and provides other benefits that we\u2019ll expand on in further posts.\r\n\r\nThe SIREN core team believes that in these early days of Ethereum and DeFi less is more, so they designed SirenSwap to be a model-less market maker. This means there is no complex on-chain pricing formula nor oracle feed required in order for it to function. This makes it easy for anyone to become an LP to potentially earn trading fees.",

Prior to Solve.Care, he had been in the CEO, COO, CIO and CTO roles at various innovative technology companies over 25 years\r\n\r\nPradeep was deeply involved in designing and building solutions for public programs such as Medicare/Medicaid, children health insurance and welfare programs, SNAP/TANF, health insurance exchanges and health information exchanges. He has worked for and with commercial insurance companies as the top technology executive, and implemented benefits administration, consumer engagement, claimed medication and payment systems. \r\n\r\nPradeep has built 4 healthcare IT companies and has been at the top of Deloitte\u2019s Technology Fast 500, INC500/5000 fastest growing companies lists multiple times. Pradeep was included in the 100 most promising entrepreneurs globally, complied by Goldman Sachs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Solve.Care Unique?\r\n\r\nThe Solve.Care platform leverages blockchain and full stack capabilities to deliver significant business value to individuals and enterprises. These business values include ease of usage, privacy, security, control and ownership of data, interoperability, auditability, and enhanced trust between parties.\r\n\r\nSolve.Care gives healthcare stakeholders a unique opportunity to build their own dApps to form Care Networks, connecting and synchronizing their participants, making instant payments inside their network, and sharing information immediately to reduce opportunities for fraud. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is unique because it not only allows networks to run independently, but to also have a fabric underneath that allows them to all communicate.\r\n\r\nAll Care Networks are fully and intrinsically tokenized to manage events, identities, transactions, payments and data sharing using the SOLVE token, which is a combination of transaction fee payment token (like Ethereum as gas), as well as a normal payment currency. The SOLVE token also has a unique property of being able to function inside the Network, either as a variable value token or as a fixed value token (as a stable coin). This property makes it uniquely powerful and appropriate for healthcare usage. \r\n\r\n\r\nSolve.Care has built blockchain healthcare networks for the real-world clients such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Uber Health, Lyft, Aon, Arizona Care Network and others. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is the first company in the world to successfully deploy digital currency and blockchain technology for value-based payments in US healthcare.

Community members can create Cellars that execute on an investment strategy through smart contracts. Cellars are powered by Strategy Providers (SPs) who develop trading strategies and send the recommended actions to the Sommelier Validators to be executed on the Cellar with the intention of gaining yield.\r\n\r\nCellars can be strategies like:\r\nA portfolio of BTC and ETH that is rebalanced based on price trends that machine learning algorithms identify\r\nAn NFT trading strategy that leverages Twitter sentiment around particular collections\r\nA strategy that hedges liquidity provision on DEXes\r\n\r\nSommelier employs a unique architecture consisting of the Sommelier Cosmos SDK blockchain, an off-chain execution environment that keeps strategies private while allowing them to leverage a wide variety of off-chain data modeling techniques, and one of the best performing ETH bridges. Strategy instructions are passed across this bridge to reposition assets in Cellars. This bridge is also being expanded to allow access to other chains (like Polygon, Avalanche, etc) so strategies are not tied to just high gas ETH markets.\r\n\r\nSommelier aggregates and batches transactions, thereby reducing gas fees, providing an attractive alternative to Ethereum\u2019s high transaction costs. As for security, Sommelier uses a decentralized governance mechanism run by validators, ensuring state-of-the-art safety of user funds. Validators pass strategy instructions across the bridge, but users\u2019 assets are never moved across it, instead being deployed directly into Cellars. Further, Cellars are non-custodial, meaning that users can withdraw their assets at any time, while strategy providers never have ownership of those assets.",

The project was launched on October 5, 2018 and is one of the pioneer cryptocurrency startups in the Philippines. The project aims to fast track mainstream adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency through an ecosystem of practical products and services.\r\n\r\nSparkPoint started with an initial funding of $50,000. With only this minimal capital combined with discipline, determination, and hard work, the team was able to launch various blockchain-based products and services including SparkPoint Wallet, SparkLearn, SparkPlay, SparkEarn, and SparkDeFi. These products and services have collectively reached hundreds of thousands of users and are steadily growing.\r\n\r\nThe SparkPoint Ecosystem is composed of:\r\n\r\nSparkPoint Wallet\r\n\r\nNon-custodial mobile cryptocurrency wallet that natively supports various cryptocurrencies including SparkPoint (SRK), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and other ERC-20 tokens. It also offers built-in Decentralized Exchanges including Uniswap, ChangeNOW, and Changelly. A virtual currency exchange (VCE) license application is ongoing to legally enable fiat integration in the SparkPoint Wallet. \r\n\r\nSparkLearn\r\n\r\nE-learning platform focused on educational content about blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and financial literacy. The platform currently offers free courses for these topics and is continuously being improved through UI/UX enhancements, onboarding of new mentors, and integrating a Learn-to-Earn model. Education is at the heart of SparkPoint. \r\n\r\nSparkPlay\r\n\r\nCollection of mobile casual games with cryptocurrency as central theme. Currently available games include Crypto Slicer, Crypto Burst, and Crypto Shooter.

A series of token burns have reduced the total supply down to 14,368,540,937 SRK tokens. Quarterly token burns are scheduled in the future to reduce the total supply to its final fixed maximum value of 10 billion SRK tokens. There are currently 6,486,932,911 SRK tokens in circulation.\r\n\r\nOf the initial total supply, 20% of the tokens were distributed to private sale participants. A minimal amount was allocated for sale to avoid any sudden fall in the price of SRK in the market. 7% of the tokens were allocated for marketing and airdrops, and 10% for community development programs. Majority of the tokens were allocated for SparkPoint Ecosystem Development at 38%. Most of the tokens that were burned were also part of this allocation.

Solarin was their first project, which gained popularity as the most secure phone in the world. Though it was a success and was endorsed by famous celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, the company declared a layoff of about one-third of the staff by 2015. The reason they announced was developments in other fields.

Now, they focus on bringing new technology for mass adoption.\r\n\r\nSIRIN Labs has a vision of creating open source and secure devices for mass adoption.

Every unit of SOL can be perceived as a unit of blockspace lent towards dApps, securing network bandwidth and TPS.\r\n\r\nThe stake delegated towards dApps, which derives an AVS SPL token, is built on top of sSOL-SOL liquidity. Similarly, LRTs are built on top of sSOL liquidity interface to generate vault strategies.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways of utilizing sSOL and earning maximum yield as an sSOL holder. You can delegate to dApps to bootstrap network bandwidth or participate in DeFi strategies to earn additional APY, starting with our launch partners.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways of utilizing sSOL and earning maximum yield as an sSOL Holder. You can delegate to dApps to bootstrap network bandwidth or participate in DeFi strategies to earn additional APY, starting with our launch partners.\r\n\r\nNow we will go through a couple of examples on how you can put your sSOL to work in AMMs, lending protocols, perpetual exchanges, and more.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nLiquidity Vaults on Kamino\r\nKamino\u2019s liquidity vaults are an automated liquidity solution that allows users to earn yield on their crypto assets by providing liquidity to concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMMs).\r\n\r\nA vault deploys liquidity into an underlying DEX pool, consisting of 2 tokens. When you deposit into a vault, you earn fees from trading volume.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you deposit into a pool with sSOL and SOL, any token swaps that utilize that pool will incur a small cost to the swapper. As a Kamino depositor, you earn from that swap fee.\r\n\r\nVault Capital Deposit Example\r\n\r\nSituation: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD. You want to earn yield on your assets without active management.\r\n\r\nUse Case: Deposit your sSOL into a Kamino vault. Your sSOL will provide liquidity to a DEX, earning fees from trading volume. Kamino automates rebalancing and compounding, maximizing your yield.\r\n\r\nBenefit: Earn yield passively while maintaining exposure to sSOL.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\nLiquidity Provision on Orca\r\nOrca utilizes a Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLAMM) to enhance capital efficiency and yield for liquidity providers. By providing liquidity to Orca\u2019s pools, users can earn yield on their crypto assets through trading fees.\r\n\r\nWhen you provide liquidity to an Orca pool, such as the sSOL-SOL pair, you earn fees from each token swap within that pool. This means if you deposit sSOL and SOL into the pool, any trades that occur between these tokens will generate fees, which are distributed to you as a liquidity provider. Orca automates this process, ensuring optimal capital efficiency and low slippage.\r\n\r\nLP Example\r\n\r\nSituation: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000 USD. You want to earn yield on your assets without active management.\r\n\r\nUse Case: Deposit your sSOL and an equivalent amount of SOL into an Orca CLAMM pool. Your sSOL and SOL will provide liquidity to the DEX, earning fees from trading volume. Orca\u2019s advanced CLAMM technology will ensure that your assets are utilized efficiently, maximizing your returns.\r\n\r\nBenefit: Earn yield passively from trading fees while maintaining exposure to both sSOL and SOL.",

CEO, and co-founder, Simon Yu, evolved this digital currency from an app called BitMaker, he and co-founder, Calvin Hsieh, worked on in 2014. BitMaker allowed users to send money without transaction fees which was the main reason this app experienced high growth volumes. A new feature called BitTask was introduced which allowed users to trade their time and effort for trying out new products in exchange for Bitcoin or Ethereum. This feature is now the STORM Play App and has experienced massive growth since its launch in Feb 2017.\r\n\r\nThe vision the founders have for STORM is beyond just an ordinary Cryptocurrency. They aim to create a marketplace for decentralized marketplace for tasks which will be called the \u201cStorm Market\u201d. \u201cThe Storm Market will operate similar to the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store in that it will serve as a platform where Storm Makers and Storm Players can create and accept tasks using smart contracts powered and paid for with STORM tokens.\u201d The team is confident of the success of the app as it strongly relies on the give and takes model. By completing relatively easy and enjoyable tasks, users can potentially earn quite a bit of STORM, Ethereum or even Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nStorm Market is targeting the freelancing industry around micro-tasks. Currently, there are identified competitors in the market like Upwork, Mechanical Turk, etc. which are circulating huge amount of money through their platform with existing inefficiencies that ultimately creates hurdles for the freelancers. They deduct huge amount from their users earning by charging 40% of transaction cost.  The Storm market is striving to resolve the problems by providing following benefits, such as as compared to traditional micro-task marketplaces, they will charge reduce transaction fees. Besides, they Eliminate the interruption of any middlemen between buyers and sellers.\r\n\r\nStorm Market is a gamified micro-task marketplace that enables users to earn by completing different tasks. The company is expanding its platform by creating decentralized storm market by incorporating blockchain technology. In storm market, people can use their skills and talents to accomplish various tasks and get good rewards for it in the form of tokens. In short, a company is aiming to operate decentralized platform where anyone can offer or engage in tasks by utilizing blockchain based smart contracts supported by tokens (ERC-20).\r\n\r\nCheck out CoinBureau for the complete review of Storm Token.",

The Storj project is owned and developed by Storj Labs Inc. Storj intends to facilitate a faster, cheaper, and secure file storage solution than traditional cloud storage platforms. To achieve its goal, Storj deploys several innovative technologies and methods to make sure that users are able to store and retrieve data in a fastest possible way while not compromising the security and integrity of data.\r\n\r\nStorj Labs Inc was founded in 2014 by Shawn Wilkinson with co-founders John Quinn. The company is headquartered at Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. Shawn was previously appointed as CEO, but in March 2018, he stepped down from the post to serve as CSO of the company.\r\n\r\nShawn was replaced by Ben Golub (Ex-CEO of Docker) who currently serves as the Executive Chairman & Interim CEO. Co-founder John Quinn has been appointed as the Chief Revenue Officer. The company launched its initial coin offering (ICO) of the new tokens on May 19, 2017. At the end of the token sale on May 25, 2017, the company had raised about $30 million. Storj Labs allowed SJCX holders to exchange their tokens with the new ones in a 1:1 ratio through a token conversion campaign which lasted till October 2017.\r\n\r\nStorj Labs pre-mined its entire supply of tokens at the inception; no new tokens can be created via STORJ mining. Nevertheless, users can obtain STORJ tokens by becoming a farmer in the network. Another obvious way to acquire STORJ is through trading on a cryptocurrency exchange. Up until now, cloud storage companies have dictated the terms of service to their users, and as a result, there has been little to no competition within this digital sector. However, with the introduction of Storj, all of that may change.\"\r\n\r\nCheck out CoinBureau for the full review on OmiseGo.",

The SYNC Network addresses these problems and offers a workable solution through tradeable stakes bonding Uniswap liquidity pairs with a fully trustless ERC-20 token (SYNC).\r\n\r\nSYNC enables users to earn interest by staking a cyptographic bond to Uniswap liquidity pair tokens (Crypto Bonds).\r\n\r\nCrypto Bonds are an NFT (ERC-721) token with collectible attributes, accruing interest rates, and the ability to separately trade and speculate on them within a secondary market.\r\n\r\nSYNC Network works to bring stability and risk mitigation to decentralized finance by solidifying a guarantee on holding liquidity pairs for an extended period of time. The Sync Network can help build a needed, stable foundation for the DeFi space and a fully functioning, more robust trustless economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe SYNC Network is composed of two main contracts: the SYNC ERC-20 contract and the Crypto Bond ERC-721 contract. SYNC tokens have an undefined total supply with inflationary and deflationary attributes through the interactions with Crypto Bond investors.\r\n\r\nDespite being a long-term investment, Crypto Bonds do not share anything in common with traditional finance bonds. The name comes from the bonding of liquidity pairs and our own token. Crypto Bonds introduce proof of long-term position in DeFi liquidity pools, and will naturally strengthen the core of DeFi finance as a whole. They are a tradeable, long-term (90 days - 3 years) stake - bonding Uniswap liquidity-pair tokens together with SYNC.\r\n\r\nDeflation of the currency happens when Crypto Bonds are created, burning SYNC from the total supply. Using a Crypto Bond, an investor is able to lock liquidity-pair tokens with the corresponding dollar-to-dollar value in SYNC at some guaranteed interest rate of SYNC upon maturation. Dividend paying versions are also available. Therefore, this occurs in inflation, minting the principle plus interest.\r\n\r\nCrypto Bond Interest Rates\r\nSYNC balances itself through daily, self-correcting interest rates.\r\nInterest rates of bonds depends on three factors.\r\n1. Total supply of sync in the market.\r\n2. Duration of bond\r\n3. Total bonded amount of that liquidity pair token\r\n\r\nPlease see the full whitepaper and website https://www.syncbond.com for more information.",

Notably, the supply of TAP is immutably preprogrammed to be finite and decay in inflation over time, there are also no emissions of TAP itself, and thus the Tapioca ecosystem features no liquidity mining program(s).\r\n\r\nThe TAP token utilizes the LayerZero V2 OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) token super-standard. This enables TAP to able to be transferred to and from any EVM or non-EVM network via a burn-and-mint model directly via its token contract- no bridges, wrappers, or other intermediaries needed.

The vast code libraries of EVM networks like Ethereum can likewise be used on TENET.\r\n\r\nThe blockchain\u2019s consensus model is an industry-first:\r\nValidate through major token\u2019s liquid staking derivatives.

Network validators have an added layer of liquidity on TENET, while they earn the yields of the LSDs. This makes DeFi instantly more liquid on the TENET blockchain. \r\n\r\nTENET is also the first blockchain to be run on native gauges. Similar to Curve Finance, the TENET token can be staked for veTenet and vote on how rewards will be distributed throughout the LSDs and apps on its entire native ecosystem.

Paxos was the first virtual currency company to receive a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services. As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.\r\n\r\nThe Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It\u2019s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos describes itself as \u201cthe first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise\u201d, and it is using that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements. What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company, and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement platform using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It\u2019s been picked up and listed by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, OKEx, Gate.io, ZB, KuCoin and DigiFinex. These exchanges are offering PAX as an alternative to the controversial Tether. Unlike the controversy surrounding the people who control Tether, there is no such obscurity when it comes to the people behind Paxos. The CEO and co-founder is Charles Cascarilla. He has over 15 years in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.\r\n\r\nThe Pax Dollar (USDP) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution. The Paxos team has been fairly clear in declaring the different base that PAX is working from. ",

Since 2015, Bitcoin.com has been a global leader in introducing newcomers to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. With over 50 million self-custody wallets created (as of Jun 2024) in its multichain DeFi-ready mobile app (the Bitcoin.com Wallet app), an award-winning news portal with over 2.5 million monthly readers, a wide range of educational resources, and 24-hour human support, Bitcoin.com is the world\u2019s gateway to Bitcoin and beyond. By incentivizing and gamifying engagement in the Bitcoin.com ecosystem, VERSE supercharges Bitcoin.com\u2019s mission to onboard the world to decentralized money and increase economic freedom. \r\n\r\nWhat makes VERSE different?\r\nVERSE is seamlessly integrated in the Bitcoin.com ecosystem and readily accessible to millions of users. Bitcoin.com attracts and retains millions of newcomers to crypto every year via its powerful brand, domain, and products. The ecosystem guides newcomers on their own individual journeys, enabling them to benefit from the rapidly expanding range of applications in crypto. \r\n\r\nWhat is the utility of VERSE token?\r\nVERSE can be earned by using products in Bitcoin.com\u2019s ecosystem, held for discounts and perks, and used in apps and dApps. In late 2023, fxVERSE was deployed on Polygon, paving the way for a micro-rewards system. \r\n\r\nWhat are the key components of the Bitcoin.com VERSE ecosystem? \r\nAt the heart of the ecosystem is the multichain Bitcoin.com Wallet app. Within the app, users can find a web3-enabled browser called Verse Explorer that allows for convenient interaction with a variety of dApps and web3 features. These include the multichain decentralized exchange Verse DEX, the Verse Voyager NFT collection and minting dApp, and a range of engaging dApps that are designed to educate users on how to safely interact with web3 products.\r\n\r\nHow does the buy back and burn mechanism work? \r\nBitcoin.com buys VERSE on the open market through Bitcoin.com\u2019s decentralized exchange Verse DEX, third-party DEXs, centralized exchanges, or in Over-The-Counter trades. This VERSE is then sent to the Verse Burn Engine, where it accumulates until a burn is triggered (anyone can trigger a burn). \r\n\r\nWhat is the sustainable supple reduction mechanism?\r\nVERSE is allocated from the Ecosystem Fund to the Verse Burn Engine in a manner that is proportional to a given activity in the Verse/Bitcoin.com ecosystem, as well as in a manner that ensures that the reduction of supply is sustainable over the lifetime of the token.\r\n",

The meme format typically includes an image of an animal or person, often with a cowboy hat added digitally to emphasize the Southern aspect. The phrase \"What in tarnation?\" is an archaic and humorously exaggerated way of saying \"What in the world?\" or \"What on Earth?\" The comedic element is enhanced by the juxtaposition of the cowboy hat with subjects that are incongruous or absurd, creating a visual pun. The text that accompanies these images usually follows the structure of \"What in [X]\" where [X] is a playful substitution that rhymes with \"tarnation\" or is related to the context of the image, adding another layer of humor. For example, if the image includes a Shiba Inu dog with a cowboy hat, the caption might playfully read, \"What in doggernation?\" which rhymes with tarnation and fits the image of the dog.

        "description": "What is Navcoin (NAV)?\r\n\r\nNavcoin, launched in 2014, is an open-sourced digital currency offering fast and reliable payments with innovative technological and privacy features. Storing coins on a Navcoin wallet allows for making public or private transactions, earning rewards through staking (for network validation) or mixing coins (for privacy enhancement), and having a vote in project proposals.\r\n\u2028Unique to Navcoin\u2019s cryptosystem is that public NAV coins can be converted 1:1 to xNAV, the revolutionary privacy coin that guarantees untraceable transactions. Additionally, Navcoin has launched wNAV, a wrapped representation of NAV, that can be used in ecosystems such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\u2028\u2028Navcoin was launched without pre-mining or an ICO to achieve a fair and transparent initial distribution of the supply. The project operates as a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), without a central decision making authority (unlike most other projects). Anyone can participate by simply staking NAV in their wallet, thereby obtaining a say in protocol governance and a vote on proposals that arise from within the community.\u2028\u2028How are Navcoin\u2019s privacy-enhanced features achieved?\r\n\u2028Navcoin\u2019s philosophy is to provide people with privacy preserving solutions that allow them to express themselves financially and transact as they desire. This has resulted in the development of xNAV, a privacy coin based on the decentralized, trustless, and permissionless technologies of the future.\u2028\u2028First of all, xNAV is built on top of the self-developed privacy protocol blsCT that merges Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) Signatures and Confidential Transactions (CT). BLS compresses a group of signatures into a single compact signature that authenticates the entire group, thereby shielding the origin of individual transactions. CT is a well-established privacy protocol that obfuscates the amount of coins in a transaction.\u2028\u2028On top of that, xNAV ensures personal privacy by using Stealth Addresses, public-key cryptography and the innovative Dandelion++ protocol. Stealth Addresses are private addresses which ensure complete privacy for the receiver of a transaction. Dandelion++ is a communication mixing protocol which breaks the link between a message and its source. \r\n\r\nWhen using blsCT, two xNAV transactions can be merged into one, and transactions can be aggregated an infinite number of times. This allows Navcoin to scale effectively and support a high quantity of transactions across the network and users\u2019 transactions are completely shielded and untraceable. Anyone trying to monitor transactions being made through Navcoin\u2019s network is unable to tell if a transaction has been aggregated or not, and users are able to merge their coins with other individuals making transactions. When doing so, a user\u2019s wallet uses Dandelion++ to send an anonymous request for coins from other nodes. These nodes can then connect and communicate between them using public-key cryptography to broadcast the session and their coins to mix. From those, the sender can randomly select several coins from the responses received. These coins are in turn mixed together with the original user\u2019s coins, and then sent to the network, and this system ensures true privacy while also enabling anyone who helps to facilitate the mixing-process by providing liquidity to receive a fee for their service, and generate a passive income.\u2028\u2028Combining these technologies, xNAV stands out in scalability and privacy, effectively supporting high quantities of transactions across the network with shielded and untraceable transactions.\u2028\u2028How is Navcoin\u2019s network secured?\r\n\u2028Navcoin\u2019s network is secured by a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which means that anyone can use their NAV to help validate transaction blocks. By comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism requires miners to calculate huge mathematical problems to process transactions and earn rewards. This requires expensive hardware and is extremely energy intensive. Navcoin\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism does away with these resource intensive requirements; even a 5 Volt Raspberry Pi can take part in securing the network.\u2028\r\nNavcoin\u2019s users can earn passive income in two distinct ways. First of all, users can help secure the network by staking NAV to validate transactions. With block times of 30 seconds, the block reward is 2.5 NAV. Of each reward, 2 NAV are for the staker, and 0.5 NAV are held in a decentralized treasury, the Community Fund, used for self-funded community initiatives. \u2028\u2028Users can also mutually merge their xNAV coins over various nodes to facilitate the mixing process that ensures xNAV\u2019s privacy and anonymity. Users are rewarded a fair compensation fee in return for this service.\r\n\r\nHow is Navcoin\u2019s network governed?\r\n\r\nIn addition to helping to secure the network, Navcoin\u2019s PoS consensus mechanism enables all public NAV holders to get involved with governing their platform. There is no central authority controlling Navcoin, and community members play a crucial role in maintaining a fair and decentralized system of decision making. As a result, Navcoin operates as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with all protocol administration and consensus changes being subject to an open voting system. All community members holding their NAV on the public side can participate in the DAO by staking their coins, and each stake is the equivalent of one vote. This gives each wallet holder a say in protocol governance, and allows them to vote on any proposals that arise. To ensure widespread participation, there is also no minimum staking amount required for anyone to take part in voting. \r\n\r\nNavcoin\u2019s governance system also incorporates a Community Fund to ensure that contributors and projects can be compensated and funded by the network.\r\n",

As Gordon Gekko said in the 80s whilst getting rich off useless stocks, \u201cGreed is good!\u201d. 30 years later this is still the case. Thus, Wall Street Memes is tokenising this movement, allowing ordinary people to earn profits from a \u201cuseless\u201d memecoin. Buyers can also stake their tokens and earn passive rewards.\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\nWall Street Memes is the crypto token with the highest ICO raise in history. The project also has the biggest online community with over half a million Instagram followers and almost 300K Twitter followers. The posts have even reached Elon Musk who interacted with the WSM Twitter account.\r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\nWSM Twitter was created in 2019, initially to make fun of the capitalist movement and its following grew very rapidly. In October 2021, Wall Street Bulls NFT collection was released which sold out in less than half an hour. \r\n\r\nIn 2023, the team decided to tokenise the movement by launching $WSM token on the 25th of May 2023. The presale ended on the 25th of September, reaching the highest ICO raise in history. On the 26th of September, the token was launched on OKX and HTX exchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s next for your project?\r\nWall Street Memes is going to launch on other top exchanges in the following days and aims to launch on other Tier 1 exchanges in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nApart from allowing people to gain from a movement which makes fun of useless assets and the capitalist movement, buyers can also earn passive rewards by staking their tokens. \r\n",

        "description": "Arcana Network is a leading Chain Abstraction Protocol powered by a modular Layer 1.\r\nArcana\u2019s Chain Abstraction eliminates asset fragmentation and the friction of bridging between chains.\r\nIt offers users a Unified Balance of their USDC, USDT, and ETH balances across chains, allowing them to spend their entire balance on any chain instantly, without bridging\u2014a seamless, bridgeless, and near-instant experience.\r\n\r\nWeb3 ecosystem has exploded with 100s of L1s, L2s, rollups, sidechains, and appchains, adding immense friction for users trying new chains, while chains struggle to attract and retain users and maintain TVL. Arcana solves this by providing unified balances, auto-funding gas fees with stablecoins, and near-instant multi-chain transactions. \r\n\r\nIn addition to these, $XAR\u2019s Chain Abstraction Protocol does three things extremely well compared to other protocols:\r\n\r\n- EOA Wallet-Based Orchestration: Users can bring existing wallet addresses without locking funds or depositing into new accounts\u2014maintaining full self-custody of assets.\r\n- Gas Efficiency: Upto 5X lower gas fees compared to smart contract-based chain abstraction protocols\r\n- Universal Addresses: Arcana does not create app-specific wallets that require users to deposit tokens. So users assets remain in a single wallet, accessible across apps \u2014even on apps that do not support chain abstraction.\r\n\r\nThe Chain Abstraction protocol is live on Testnet, with a Mainnet release planned for Q1 2025. Users can experience Chain Abstraction through Arcana Wallet, a Chrome extension launched in Oct 2024, or via the SDK integrated by app developers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Arcana Network?\r\n\r\nFounded in 2021 by CEO, Mayur Relekar, and Co-founders Aravindh Kumar and Abhishek Chaudhary, Arcana Network aims to be the most developer-focused chain abstraction protocol enabling high performance and user-friendly apps.\r\nMayur is a seasoned 3x entrepreneur who previously served as a venture studio's chief product officer. The founders have been building and experimenting in the Web3 space across different verticals since 2018 and founded Arcana based on the challenges they had faced as Web3 developers.\r\n\r\n\r\nArcana\u2019s Other Products Include:\r\n1. Arcana Auth SDK:  An easy way for developers to onboard users and provide them with a non-custodial wallet. Users can log in using their email or social accounts and instantly receive a secure in-app wallet\u2014no passwords, seed phrases, or installations required. It\u2019s the fastest decentralized social login in Web3, with a sub-5-second login time\r\n2. Arcana Gasless: ERC-4337-based Account Abstraction, enabling developers to sponsor gas fees for users.\r\n3. SendIt: The \u201cPayPal of crypto.\u201d SendIt allows users to send crypto to an email address, simplifying crypto payments and making them accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nAcross these previously launched products, Arcana has experienced tremendous growth. Arcana Auth has generated over 4 Million wallets with 5,000+ apps deployed, since its launch in February 2023. SendIt has onboarded over 500,000 users, who have completed more than 5 Million transactions, since August 2023.\r\n\r\nSince its inception in 2021, Arcana has raised 4.5Mn+ USD from leading investors and founders in the ecosystem such as Balaji Srinivasan, Founders of Polygon, Polygon Ventures, Woodstock, Republic Crypto, Digital Currency Group, Fenbushi, and 40+ investors.\r\nArcana\u2019s native token, $XAR, had its Reg D public token sale on the Republic platform on November 29, 2023, and is listed on Bybit, Gate, and MEXC.",

Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.\r\n\r\nDistributed Exchange\r\nThrough the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.\r\n\r\nThis multi-currency transaction is possible because of \"Anchors\". Anchors are trusted entities that hold people\u2019s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.\r\n\r\nLumens (XLM)\r\nLumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.\r\n\r\nIn-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. \r\n\r\nPrior to Protocol 12, Stellar had a built-in inflation mechanism conceived to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated lumens toward projects built on Stellar.\r\n\r\nAs the network evolved and grew, it became increasingly clear that inflation wasn\u2019t working as intended \u2014 account holders either didn\u2019t set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves, and the operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise \u2014 and so a protocol change to disable inflation was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe inflation operation is now deprecated.\r\nhttps://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/inflation/\r\n",

Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.\r\n\r\nRipple was originally founded by a single company, Ripple Labs, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue bitcoin\u2019s development. It also doesn\u2019t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself \u2014 around 60 billion at the latest count.\r\n\r\nEven at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple\u2019s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this). It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value, and isn\u2019t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.\r\n\r\nXRP by Ripple price can be found on this page alongside the market capitalization and additional stats.\r\n\r\n",

If it is, one can set up applications which execute transactions in the smart contract.\r\n\r\nThis has opened up a new world of possibilities. The applications of such a technology are infinite.\r\n\r\nTake for example an eCommerce Company. With the XYO Network, they could now offer their premium customers payment-upon-delivery services. To be able to offer this service, the eCommerce company would leverage the XYO Network (which uses XYO Tokens) to write a smart contract.\r\n\r\nThe XYO Network could then track the location of the package being sent to the consumer along every single step of fulfillment; from the warehouse shelf to the shipping courier, all the way into the consumer's house and every location in between. This could enable eCommerce retailers and websites to verify, in a trustless way, that the package not only appeared on the customer's doorstep, but also safely inside their home.",

Zcash payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remain private.\r\n\r\nZcash is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic research, and built by a security-specialized engineering team on an open source platform based on Bitcoin Core's battle-tested codebase. Our improvement over Bitcoin is the addition of privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.\r\n\r\nHow Zcash works\r\n\r\nZcash encrypts the contents of shielded transactions. Since the payment information is encrypted, the protocol uses a novel cryptographic method to verify their validity.\r\n\r\nZcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography. These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.\r\n\r\nZcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin. With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly. Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value. \r\n\r\nCheck out CoinBureau for guide on What is ZCash.",

Zilliqa is mainly based on the concept of Sharding and primarily aims at improving the scalability of the cryptocurrency networks as in case of Bitcoin or Ethereum. The white paper mentions that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa\u2019s high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms. Zilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network.

        "description": "Zilliqa (ZIL) is a token developed in the year 2017. Zilliqa is mainly based on the concept of Sharding and primarily aims at improving the scalability of the cryptocurrency networks as in case of Bitcoin or Ethereum. The white paper mentions that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa\u2019s high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms. Zilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network.

The foundation of this ecosystem is zondacrypto, a cryptocurrency exchange launched in 2014, which has since become one of the largest in Central Europe. Another significant platform within the ZND ecosystem is zondacrypto Pay, a payment processor that enables entrepreneurs, marketplaces, and platforms to accept cryptocurrency payments for their goods and services.\r\nThe most recent addition to the ecosystem, launched in December 2023, is the ZND platform, an innovative digital asset management solution created in collaboration with ICEO Venture Builder and Zondacrypto. It focuses on four essential pillars for users engaged in the cryptocurrency market: Trade, Earn, Borrow, and Explore. The platform is designed with simplicity in mind, allowing even those with minimal experience to easily navigate and participate in trading and other activities.\r\nAt the core of this ecosystem is the ZND Token, which functions as the primary settlement unit across all platforms. The token represents trust and loyalty within the community, serving as a reward for key engagement mechanisms throughout the ecosystem.\r\nThe ZND Token is a versatile asset within the ZND ecosystem, offering multiple utilities that enhance user engagement and market stability.\r\nIn the \"Earn\" service, users can lock their crypto assets like BTC or ETH and choose to receive rewards in $ZND, with flexible reward structures giving up to 20% $ZND additional bonus. This farming mechanism offers a seamless way to accumulate $ZND without direct market purchases, increasing demand for the token.\r\nThe Staking Program allows users to freeze $ZND for long-term rewards, offering high APRs, loyalty-based benefits, and early withdrawal options with penalty fees. This program withdraws significant $ZND from circulation, contributing to market stability. \r\n\r\nThe Loyalty Program encourages platform activity by offering exclusive rewards, such as special pool bonuses filled from penalty fees and trading costs. Loyalty tiers unlock greater perks, fostering deeper community engagement.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Token Burning mechanism ensures $ZND remains a deflationary asset, with periodic burns reducing the token supply and supporting long-term growth.",

Avoiding locking your tokens up with the BNB Chain network is a big advantage \u2014 it allows you to use the value of your staked tokens to earn multiple layers of rewards on DeFi platforms and multiply your ROI potential. As Liquid Staking solves the capital inefficiency problem of (Nominated) Proof-of-stake networks, it offers a way to earn additional rewards on your staked BNB, enabling new yield farming strategies, arbitrage trading, lending, and more will all be possible using the value of your staked assets.\r\n\r\nankrBNB is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrBNB token vs. BNB increases over time as staking rewards accumulate.\r\n\r\nNo technical knowledge is required\r\n\r\nReceive an easier staking experience with no technical knowledge necessary. Liquid Staking makes staking as easy as a swap: exchange your BNB for the reward-bearning ankrBNB token. Enhanced decentralization Our BNB Liquid Staking will not use only Ankr validator nodes to stake the BNB from users. Ankr Staking will select several suitable and reliable BNB Chain validators, making BNB Liquid Staking as decentralized as possible. This means that Ankr will not contribute to giving any party more influence over the BNB Chain network as the BNB will be spread over a wide variety of nodes. Ultimately, the goal is to have Ankr governance decide on the target allocation to different validator nodes.\r\n\r\nContribute to the security of the BNB Chain network\r\n\r\nStaking with BNB Liquid Staking allows you to play an important role in boosting the network\u2019s security as a whole. Ankr\u2019s BNB staking system distributes staked tokens intelligently across the BNB Chain ecosystem to help the network achieve optimal decentralization. Diversity and decentralization of active validators both ensure the network remains as secure as possible.\r\n",

To start on the right foot and to establish EMAX as a long-term project, we had no biased pre-sale event as 100% of the tokens were released on the open market, we locked liquidity to support the project, and founder wallets have been locked and verified as a sign of commitment to deepen trust within the community.\r\n\r\nEMAX is a long-term project with a bold vision, strategic roadmap, and united community to accomplish lofty goals few have ever imagined, let alone conquered \u2013 and we plan on doing just that.",

Quadrant aims to provide a blueprint for mapping disparate data sources. It will support proof of data authenticity and provenance via data stamping, the creation of \u201cConstellations\u201d (data smart contracts) for disparate data sources, and fair remuneration and incentive sharing. Data Consumers can trust the authenticity of the data they purchase, \u201cNurseries\u201d (Data Producers) are compensated fairly every time their data is used, and \u201cPioneers\u201d (Data Vendors) have the incentive to create innovative Constellations. This new transparent ecosystem ensures that companies get the authentic data they need.\r\n\r\nWhere Quadrant has major potential for impact is the ability it provides \u201cElons\u201d (the brightest data minds) to find linkages between different constellations and, in turn, create mega Constellations that can be used by Data Consumers to solve real-world problems. This is where Quadrant differentiates itself from its competitors.\r\n\r\nQuadrant is designed to work with both centralised and decentralised services. The architecture consists of the core Quadrant blockchain, clients (Data Producer, Data Consumer and Anchor), and Guardian Nodes. Quadrant will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism so that it can handle more transactions, operate at a lower gas price, achieve faster transactions, and restrict malicious nodes from entering data into the network. An external Proof of Work chain will be used as an anchor for security purposes. For the time being, the Ethereum blockchain will be used for anchoring but it can be replaced by any public chain in the future if needed.\r\n\r\nQuadrant will utilise two different currencies for its network: eQuad and QUAD. QUAD, a utility token, is designed to be used solely on the network. It will be used to stamp data, support simple and complex access structures, simple and complex subscription payments, and for staking by Elons. eQuad is an ERC-20-compliant token that will be sold during the Token Generation Event (TGE). It may be converted into QUAD via a gateway when the Quadrant mainnet is launched.\r\n\r\n",

EosDAC will seek to have it\u2019s tokens listed on a number of major cryptocurrency exchanges.\r\n\r\n75% of eosDAC tokens (900,000,000) have been allocated for an airdrop to EOS token holders. All EOS token holders holding over 100 tokens* at the end of Day 300 of the EOS crowdsale (April 15th 2018, 01:00:00 UTC) will receive 1 eosDAC token for each EOS token that they hold, these tokens will be transferred directly into their Ethereum (ERC20 compatible) wallet. The actual airdrop will be made as soon as possible after this date and after we have run necessary tests and checks.\r\n\r\nAll Ethereum accounts that have 100 or more EOS tokens in them at the snapshot on the 15th April will automatically receive the airdrop. Any accounts with less than 100 tokens will not automatically receive the airdrop but will be eligible (until 15th May 2018) to apply using eosdac.io/airdrop.\r\n\r\nWhile eosDAC will now include Crypto Exchange wallets in the airdrop, you will need to contact your exchange directly to check that they will distribute the eosDAC tokens to an eosDAC wallet under your control. If your exchange is not prepared to do this you would need to withdraw your EOS tokens to an exchange that does support the eosDAC airdrop, or better still to an ethereum address for which you have the private key.

Pocket Network decentralizes how this process works to deliver more value to all users than would be possible without using blockchain, and to ultimately fulfil Pocket Network's vision of enabling \"a future where the world's most important digital infrastructure is owned and governed by its users.\"\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\n\r\nA DAO governs Pocket Network comprised of participating stakeholders using a unique \"proof-of-participation\" governance model that avoids plutocracy and focuses more on ensuring widespread representation of the most active and impactful members of Pocket's community. \r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\n\r\nThe idea for Pocket was forged in 2017, but Pocket's main net launch was on 28 July 2020. \r\n\r\nPocket was the first ever decentralized RPC service, and one of the very first DePINs. \r\n\r\nSee here for an overview - https://twitter.com/POKTnetwork/status/1681316399401287680?s=20\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s next for your project?\r\n\r\nPocket is launching a new version of the protocol in the Q1 2024 that is redesigned from the ground up to provide users with the very best RPC service possible and to break the \"RPC trilemma\" so everyone can benefit from RPC that is as reliable, cost-effective and performant as possible. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Pocket is scaling through its community, with more and more gateways built on top of the protocol to grow Pocket's demand with end users, and over 7 different community teams now contributing to the development of the protocol itself. \r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\n\r\nPocket's native cryptocurrency, POKT, facilitates access to a wide network of providers supporting more than 42 chains. POKT incentivizes full nodes to exist, pessimistically validate state transitions, replicate data, and make it accessible to developers. It's analogous to a universal API token, granting access to diverse RPC services from multiple providers for whichever open data source the community decides that the protocol should support.\r\n\r\nWrapped POKT (wPOKT) is a tokenized version of POKT that runs on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.\r\n\r\nwPOKT is compliant with ERC-20 \u2014 the basic compatibility standard of the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 allowing it to be fully integrated and interoperable with Ethereum's ecosystem of DeFi and DAO tooling and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nwPOKT is backed by POKT at a 1:1 ratio via a network of validators, allowing users to transfer liquidity between the POKT and the ETH networks in a decentralized and autonomous manner.\r\n\r\nHolders of wPOKT can bridge it over to the Pocket Network blockchain to stake as a node runner, validator or directly as an application/gateway (after the upcoming upgrade) to access the relay throughput that Pocket Network provides.\r\n",
