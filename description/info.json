The decentralized marketplace provides AI-driven solutions to retailers, manufacturers, and consumers. More than 10 global retailers and manufacturers already use the solution, which may become part of OSA DC decentralized marketplace in the future. Systematic inefficiencies cost the retail industry approximately $500 billion annually. OSA DC neutralizes these inefficiencies by uniting disconnected parties (manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and third parties) within a single Ecosystem, thus fixing three major issues that hinder the retail industry today: 1 - Inventory tracking Inventory tracking: the blockchain will reduce overstocking and understocking, problems that cost retailers $400 billion every year. 2 - Consumer trust Consumer trust: the blockchain\u2019s immutable ledger will provide more reliable product data to prevent businesses from abusing consumer trust. 3 - Product waste Product waste: OSA DC will minimize supply chain product waste that loses retailers $100 billion in potential profits annually.",

In Holochain, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This could translate into higher scalability for dapps hosted on Holochain. The Holo ecosystem relies on hosts that provide processing and storage for distributed applications while earning redeemable credits.

Additionally,\u00a0another 1% is distributed among every HOGE holder. What this means is that every time HOGE is used, the value of the remaining HOGE in circulation is increased by simultaneously decreasing the supply (deflation), while also distributing HOGE to everyone using the token. As a result, every single HOGE holder has an incentive to spread the use of HOGE as much as possible.

Magneto is inclusive of the Ethereum Berlin upgrade which contains a series of EIPs optimizing gas and transactions which have implied security enhancements important for the network.After a series of 51% attacks on the Ethereum Classic network in 2020, a change to the underlying Ethash mining algorithm was considered by the community to prevent being a minority proof-of-work chain in the Ethash mining algorithm where Ethereum is dominating the hashrate.

XRP is a distributed network which means transactions occur immediately across the network - and as it is peer to peer - the network is resilient to systemic risk. XRPs aren&#39;t mined - unlike bitcoin and its peers - but each transaction destroys a small amount of XRP which adds a deflationary measure into the system.XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol- The XRP Ledger (XRPL) does not employ a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, as seen with Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, or a proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm, as with the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain. Instead, the XRP Ledger relies on a setup called the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol to validate account balances and perform transactions. The consensus works to improve the integrity of the system by preventing double-spending.",

In the Ethereum protocol and blockchain, there is a price for each operation. In order to have anything transferred or executed by the network, you have to consume or burn Gas. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency is Ether (ETH) and it is used to pay for computation time and transaction fees.The introductory whitepaper was originally published in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, the project was crowdfunded during August 2014 by fans all around the world and launched in 2015. Ethereum is developed and maintained by ETHDEV with contributions from minds across the globe. There is an Ecosystem Support Program which is a branch of the Ethereum Foundation focused on supporting projects and entities within the greater Ethereum community to promote the success and growth of the ecosystem. Multiple startups work with the Ethereum blockchain covering areas in: DeFi, NFTs, Ethereum Name Service, Wallets, Scaling, etc.The launch of Ethereum is a process divided into 4 main phases: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity.Ethereum 2.0, also known as Serenity, is the final phase of Ethereum, it aims to solve the decentralized scaling challenge. A naive way to solve Ethereum&#39;s problems would be to make it more centralized. But decentralization is too important, as it gives Ethereum censorship resistance, openness, data privacy and near-unbreakable security.The Eth2 upgrades will make Ethereum scalable, secure, and decentralized. Sharding will make Ethereum more scalable by increasing transactions per second while decreasing the power needed to run a node and validate the chain. The beacon chain will make Ethereum secure by coordinating validators across shards. And staking will lower the barrier to participation, creating a larger \u2013 more decentralized \u2013 network.The beacon chain will also introduce proof-of-stake to Ethereum. Ethereum is moving to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW). This was always the plan as it&#39;s a key part of the community&#39;s strategy to scale Ethereum via the Eth2 upgrades. However, getting PoS right is a big technical challenge and not as straightforward as using PoW to reach consensus across the networkKeep up with Ethereum upgradesFor ETH holders and Dapp users, this has no impact whatsoever, however, for users wishing to get involved, there are ways to participate in Ethereum and future Eth2-related efforts.\u00a0Get involved in Eth 2.0",

At its core is a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system that aims to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus. The project is a result of the theoretical proposals brought by proof-of-activity (PoA) and MC2 in 2013. Decred development started in April, 2014 with a single developer and expanded to include developers from btcsuite shortly thereafter.Decred is built in the spirit of open participation and we have provided below a full disclosure of the technical features of the system, wallets and mining, initial funding and distribution, project governance and development, and a group contribution timeline.Decred opted for a different funding model in an attempt to shift the risk carried by supporters to the developers of the project. Instead of asking interested parties to fund the development of the software, the developers decided to pool funds together and carry the project to completion before making it public. The consensus was that this is an ethical path given the realities of funding software development, due to the fact that the developers alone carry the risk of the project failing, whereas in the past potential users were expected to pay for coins before any code was written. We felt this was unjust.The development of Decred was funded by Company 0 and from the pockets of its developers individually. The cost of developing the project, in terms of developer pay, totals to approximately USD 250,000, which Company 0 paid to developers. An additional amount of approximately USD 165,000 has been allocated for unpaid work and individual purchases by developers. We felt that the most equitable way to handle compensation for these expenses was to perform a small premine as part of the project launch. The model is unusual in that no developer received any amount of coins for free - all coins owned by developers will either be purchased at a rate of USD 0.49 per coin from their own pockets or exchanged for work performed at the same rate.The premine consists of 8% of the total supply of 21 million coins, meaning the premine consists of 1.68 million coins. Rather than allocating the entire premine to the bring-up costs, we decided to split the premine equally between compensation for bring-up and an \"airdrop\", where we freely give an equal amount of coins to a number of airdrop participants. This means Company 0 and its developers will have put roughly USD 415,000 into the bring-up since April, 2014 and receive 4% of the total supply, 840,000 coins (at USD 0.49 per coin). The remaining 4% will be spread evenly across a list of airdrop participants as part of an effort to build the Decred network and decentralize its distribution. \u00a0Coins held by Company 0 will be used to fund its ongoing work on open-source projects, such as Decred and btcsuite.Giving away these coins in an airdrop allows us to accomplish several things at once for the project: enlarge the Decred network, further help decentralize the distribution of coins, and allow us to get coins into the hands of people who are interested in participating in the project. Decred is fundamentally about technological progress, so the airdrop will target individuals that have made contributions to advance technology in its various forms. The maximum number of airdrop participants is capped at 5,000 individuals, so we recommend registering sooner rather than later. These coins will be given away unconditionally and there is zero expectation of Decred receiving anything from you in return for these coins.Sign up for the airdrop is currently open, but the airdrop registration will commence on January 4th, 2016. People who have been selected to participate in the airdrop will receive an email that contains a link to a web registration form. This form will require airdrop participants to enter an address to which their coins can be sent. Binaries and source code will be made available so that you can generate a wallet seed and an address for your airdrop coins. Once you have entered your receiving address into the airdrop webform and submitted it, you will receive your coins on the projected launch date.Discord | YouTube",

It was developed from the previous PoS blockchain, Xaurum (XAU)\u00a0which was\u00a0migrated to the Ethereum platform to lower costs and inflation associated wwith\u00a0mantaining a Proof of Stake 2.0 cryptocurrency.Xaurum is a gold-backed\u00a0crypto asset, that derives its value from the gold reserves maintained by the Auresco Institute, a non-profit organization created by the Xaurum team. Xaurum is meant to be used as a store of value since the gold base that backs Xaurum is always growing.The former cryptocurrency,\u00a0Xaurum (XAU) had an ICO period, in which 1016 XAU coins were sold. In the RICO period, these XAU coins are exchangeable for XAUR at a 1-8000 rate. During this RICO period, anyone was also allowed to send cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the Auresco Institute to recieve newly created XAUR.\u00a0In this smart contract system, the old PoS XAU coins that were swapped and the ones that were minted in the RICO period will be\u00a0in circulation (all of these coins have been backed by gold), and the remaining supply is locked (the locked supply is not backed by gold). Xaurum users have two ways of acquiring tokens, you can earn them in the \"Goldmine\" or Mint them.\u00a0When mining on the Goldmine, users are exchanging their hashpower in a multipool. The earned coins\u00a0from staking and mining these cryptocurrencies are used to buy more gold and to release Xaurum that was previously locked into circulation, by backing it with the newly bought gold.\u00a0The\u00a0proceeds from the Multipool can also be used to buy Xaurum in an exchange and pay the miners, depending on the market value of Xaurum, mined cryptocurrencies and the gold itself.\u00a0When minting new coins, users are allowed to send fiat currencies directly to the Auresco Institute in exchange for new coins. These users are called Masternodes but they do not maintain the blockchain. Instead, they are required to have a 1000 XAUR collateral (like Dash masternodes), in order to create new coins. This ensures that any fraud attempt would not be profitable for the Xaurum masternodes.Profits from running the PoW multipool and from the Minting process are sent to the Commonwealth wallet, and allow the Xaurum system to increase their gold supply at a must faster pace than the XAUR supply itself.",

This main blockchain, called the relay chain, does not support smart contracts, but other blockchains connected to it can support them.As a result, Polkadot is set to become a growing ecosystem of cryptocurrencies that competes with other smart contract networks such as Ethereum, the Binance Smart Chain, and more. It was launched in 2020 and brings a number of technical features that help it reach its goal.The user-created blockchains, called parachains, benefit from the same security of the relay chain where transactions are permanent, but can be customized by the users. Polkadot\u2019s design allows it to become a network of blockchains with secure transactions and varying features, all while using the resources of its relay chain.Polkadot\u2019s design is new and unique, but developers and users are able to experiment in a real economic environment called the Kusama network. Kusama can be seen as a sandbox for users and developers to test early versions of what will be launched on Polkadot in a network with a valuable cryptocurrency traded on the open market.Polkadot will also include bridges, which allow the Polkadot network to interact with other blockchains. Through bridges, Polkadot users will, for example, be able to swap tokens without a centralized exchange.What Is DOT Used For?DOT is the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot network and serves as its governance token. DOT holders can stake their tokens to vote on network upgrades and help decide the future of Polkadot by actively participating in its governance.DOT holders can influence the project\u2019s governance by voting on changes, and by electing the Council members. These are responsible for proposing changes and determining which ones are made to the software.Staking DOT also yields returns as holders are at the same time securing the network and validating transactions. Polkadot rewards DOT stakers with newly minted tokens based on the amount they are staking.DOT can also be bonded to connect a chain to Polkadot as a parachain. The token has the ability t be locked for a specific period to secure a parachain slot in the network.Who Created Polkadot?The Polkadot project was founded by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, along with Peter Czaban and Robert Habermeier in 2016. Wood is the developer behind Solidity, the coding language used to write smart contracts on Ethereum and has experience as a research scientist at Microsoft.Wood is the president of the Web3 Foundation, a non-profit organization that conducted Polkadot\u2019s token sales. The foundation was co-founded with Pete Czaban and received 30% of the proceeds. IT oversees the allocation of funds to further the development of Polkadot.The Web3 Foundation also maintains Polkadot\u2019s open-source code and supports its use.Where Can You Buy DOT?The cryptocurrency is currently being traded on most top cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, OKEx, and others. You can find out more about Polkadot and its trading volume on our analysis tab.\"This page refers to the new DOT which is 100x smaller than the old DOT (the DOT token underwent a redenomination from its original sale on 21 August 2020 at 16:40 UTC, block number 1,248,328)\"Telegram |\u00a0Discord | YouTube",

More importantly, by introducing tokens as an end-user incentive mechanism the Theta Network allows video platforms to deepen viewer engagement, drive incremental revenuesTheta Fuel (TFUEL)\u00a0is the operational token of the Theta protocol. TFUEL is used for on-chain operations like payments to Edge Node relayers for sharing a video stream, or for deploying or interacting with smart contracts.

There were 5 billion TFUEL at genesis of Theta blockchain, and the supply increases annually at a fixed percentage set at the protocol level. In December 2020, Theta Labs\u00a0announced Theta 3.0, which introduces a new crypto-economics design for TFuel, in particular, the concept of TFuel staking and burning.

By using a fixed APY calculation, each beach will mint less SURF per block as the price of SURF increases, and more SURF per block as the price decreases. The goal of this phase is to provide a strong foundation for Phase 2 by getting the majority of the SURF supply into the hands of hodlers. During this phase, the Whirlpool won\u2019t be active, but it will be accruing a mountain of SURF that will eventually get rewarded to those that provide SURF-ETH liquidity on Uniswap and stake their LP tokens in the Whirlpool.Phase 2: Reward the Hodlers - Phase 2 starts the moment Phase 1 ends, which is when SURF #10,000,000 gets minted and rewarded to someone staked in a beach. The beaches will close, the Whirlpool will activate, and all of its accrued SURF will start getting paid out to those staking their SURF-ETH Uniswap LP tokens. There will also be many projects launching within the SURF ecosystem that will continually pay dividends to everyone staked in the Whirlpool. As a fairly distributed governance token, SURF will be controlled by those that value it the most. All of the most impactful parameters in the protocol can be adjusted through successful governance proposals, ensuring that the community of SURF hodlers can continually experiment and improve it.",

Amp tokens used as collateral are generally released when consensus for a particular transfer is achieved, making them available to collateralize another transfer. In the event that consensus is not achieved for the transfer, the Amp collateral can instead be liquidated to cover losses.Flexa uses Amp to secure transactions and build networks that accrue value both securely and transparently.At the core of the Amp collateral model is the concept of the collateral partition. Collateral partitions represent subsets of Amp tokens that provide collateral for particular purposes, and are distinguished on the Ethereum blockchain with unique partition addresses. Each collateral partition can be endowed with its own set of rules regarding transfer hooks and privileges, and can also implement a predefined partition strategy in order to enable special capabilities (e.g., collateral models in which tokens are staked without ever leaving their original address).On Tuesday, September 8, 2020, Flexacoin ($FXC)\u00a0became available to migrate to Amp ($AMP).

These synthetic assets are collateralized by the Synthetix Network Token (SNX) which when locked in the contract enables the issuance of synthetic assets (Synths). This pooled collateral model enables users to perform conversions between Synths directly with the smart contract, avoiding the need for counterparties.This mechanism is designed to solve the liquidity and slippage issues experienced by DEX\u2019s. Synthetix currently supports synthetic fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies (long and short) and commodities. SNX holders are incentivised to stake their tokens as they are paid a pro-rata portion of the fees generated through activity on Synthetix.Exchange, based on their contribution to the network. It is the right to participate in the network and capture fees generated from Synth exchanges, from which the value of the SNX token is derived. Trading on Synthetix.Exchange does not require the trader to hold SNX.How SNX backs SynthsAll Synths are backed by SNX tokens. Synths are minted when SNX holders stake their SNX as collateral using Mintr, a decentralised application for interacting with the Synthetix contracts. Synths are currently backed by a 750% collateralisation ratio, although this may be raised or lowered in the future through community governance mechanisms. SNX stakers incur debt when they mint Synths, and to exit the system (i.e. unlock their SNX) they must pay back this debt by burning Synths.Synthetix is also currently trialling Ether as an alternative form of collateral. This means traders can borrow Synths against their ETH and begin trading immediately, rather than needing to sell their ETH. Staking ETH requires a collateralisation ratio of 150% and creates a debt denominated in ETH, so ETH stakers mint sETH rather than sUSD and do not participate in the \u2018pooled debt\u2019 aspect of the system. In this model, ETH stakers do not receive fees or rewards as they take no risk for the debt pool.\u00a0Discord | Litepaper",

Radicle Link extends Git with peer-to-peer discovery by disseminating data via a process called gossip. That is, participants in the network share and spread data they are \"interested\" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing, otherwise known as \"replicating\", their local data with selected peers. By leveraging Git&#39;s smart transfer protocol, Radicle Link keeps Git&#39;s efficiency when it comes to data replication while offering global decentralized repository storage through the peer-to-peer networking layer.Since all data on the network is stored locally by peers on the network, developers can share and collaborate on Git repositories without relying on intermediaries such as hosted servers.The easiest way to use Radicle is with Upstream, a desktop client developed by the founding team of the Radicle project.

It aims to allow applications to operate on multiple blockchains through the creation of the first blockchain operating system.That operating system is called the Overledger Network and connects different blockchains using APIs. The operating system allows developers to build decentralized multi-chain applications (called MApps) for their users.What is QNT used for?For developers to create a MApp on the network they must hold a specific amount of QNT tokens. These tokens power the Overledger Network and are used to pay for services developed on top of it. QNT is an ERC-20 token.Who created Quant?Quant says its technology is the brainchild of its cofounder Gilbert Verdian, who while serving at HM Treasury in the UK Government in 2009, and later as Chief Information Security Officer for a Department of Health in Australia \u201crealised the full potential of DLTs [distributed ledger technologies].\u201dThe platform was also cofounded by Dr Paolo Tasca, an entrepreneur and digital economist specialized in distributed systems. Dr. Tasca has served as a special advisor on blockchain technology at the United Nations and worked with central banks throughout the world.Where can you buy QNT?Quant\u2019s QNT token is being traded on major cryptocurrency exchanges, now including on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro. You can find out more about which currencies QNT is traded against and on which platforms on our analysis tab.Telegram | LinkedIn | YouTube",

Easily transferable for a quick turnover without the need of intermediary brokers, the OMC asset will be the choice dividend vehicle for investors around the globe.

The loan interest guarantees a biweekly issuance of dividends, while the altcoin trading revenue is a major bonus, many times greater than loan yields. The trading yields aren&#39;t guaranteed biweekly as there may be an occurrence where there is a net loss during the timeframe.

The move came shortly after Tether\u2019s USDT was added to it in September 2020.What is Solana?Solana is a high-performance blockchain founded by former Qualcomm, Intel, and Dropbox engineers that uses a delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) consensus algorithm. The network uses a unique method of ordering transactions to significantly improve its speed and throughput.Blockchain networks have historically struggled with scalability issues, with the few that managed to solve them dealing with centralization issues. A decentralized network with small confirmation times and transaction fees has been hard to create, but the problem was tackled in 2017 with the creation of Solana.Using what\u2019s known as Proof-of-History (PoH), the Solana blockchain is able to handle thousands of transactions per second. PoH uses Verifiable Delay Functions to hash incoming events and transactions to allow nodes to locally generate timestamps of SHA256 computations, eliminating the need for timestamps to be broadcasted across the network.According to the Solana team, there are eight major innovations allowing the network to scale to serve the web with capabilities matching those of a centralized system. The network has 400ms block times and can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second.The network has already processed well over 21 billion transactions while handling over 800 transactions per second of real demand.What is the SOL token?The Solana blockchain has a native cryptocurrency, the SOL utility token. SOL is used to pay for transaction fees when moving funds around and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain.Anyone holding SOL tokens can interact with applications on the network, the same way anyone holding ETH can interact with applications on the Ethereum blockchain. While Ethereum uses the ERC token protocol, Solana uses the SPL protocol.SOL has two main use cases: It\u2019s used to pay for transaction fees and to interact with smart contracts It can be staked as part of the dPoS consensus mechanism to earn staking rewardsApart from these two use cases, decentralized applications being built on top of the Solana blockchain create new ones. These applications may allow SOL to be used as collateral for cryptocurrency-backed loans, or to be lent out to earn interest.You can find out how to stake Solana on our guide, which covers various methods of doing so.Where Can You Buy SOL?The cryptocurrency is currently being traded on most top cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, Bitfinex, Binance, and FTX. You can find out where to buy SOL on the cryptocurrency\u2019s markets page on CryptoCompare.Telegram | Discord | Youtube\u00a0| Reddit | MediumWhitepaper",
